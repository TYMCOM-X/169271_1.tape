             The page  length  is  set  by  default  for  video
             terminals  only.  Therefore, the notation N/A (not
             applicable) appears in the table under LENGTH  for
             hard-copy terminals.

        SET TTY arg

             Sets a characteristic for your terminal.

                  NO                  NO  turns  off  the  bits  set  by  the  argument  it
                  accompanies.   For example, SET TTY LC sets lowercase
                  capability.   SET  TTY  NO  LC  turns  off  lowercase
                  ability.

                            terminals,  because NO BLANKS will conserve
                            space on the screen, allowing  more  output

                            CRLF gives an automatic RETURN at the  edge
                            of  the terminal screen.  This feature does

        DEBREAK             Notifies the system that the terminal has a
                            feature  that  allows  the computer to lock

                            This  is  used  when  you  type  characters
                            before the output is finished.  DEFER holds
                            the characters until the output is done; NO
                            DEFER  allows  them  to  be  echoed on your
                            terminal before the output is done.

        DISPLAY             Notifies the system that the  terminal  you
                            are  using is a display terminal.  Programs
                            use this information to control  output  to

|       EIGHTBIT            Enables the terminal to accept and generate
|                           eight  bit characters.  A terminal set with
|                           the  EIGHTBIT  switch  will  be   able   to

                            output the line-feeds.
                            FORM is a declaration that the terminal has
                            the capability of
                            generating the line-feeds. The default is

        LC                  Controls  the  translation   of   lowercase
                            letters to uppercase letters.  NO LC allows
                            all  characters   to   be   translated   to
                            uppercase by the monitor.

                            Frequently, it  is  convenient  to  have  a
                            terminal  with both uppercase and lowercase
                            simulate the behavior of one with uppercase
                            only.   TTY  NO  LC  causes  the monitor to
                            perform this  simulation.   The  echo  sent
                            back by the monitor always matches the case
                            of the characters  after  translation.   By
                            looking  at  the  output, you can determine
                            whether translation was  performed  by  the
                            monitor.     The   default   condition   is
                            determined by the declared terminal type.

        LENGTH n            Specifies number of lines on terminal  page
                            and  stops  output to your terminal after n
                            lines.  You can use CTRL/S and CTRL/Q after
                            using  this command.  Refer to Section 1.5.
                            CTRL/S stops output; CTRL/Q continues.   If
                            you  use SET TTY LENGTH with no argument or
                            with the argument of 0, the system does not
                            automatically  stop output, but you can use
                            CTRL/S and CTRL/Q to control  output.   The
                            default   argument  is  determined  by  the
                            declared terminal type.

                            SBELL, SSTOP, STOP, XONXOF  will  use  this
                            value as the page length.

                            This  argument  is   useful   for   display
                            terminals  because  it prevents output from
                            scrolling off the screen.  When  output  is
                            stopped  by  the  system after n lines, the
                            terminal  bell  rings.    Use   CTRL/Q   to
                            continue output to your terminal.

                            login.  For specific information on account
                            characteristics,   including   LOCAL  line,
                            refer  to  the  REACT  description  in  the

        RTCOMPATIBILITY     Disables the CTRL/R  and  CTRL/T  features.
                            (Refer  to Section 1.5 for a description of
                            CTRL/R  and  CTRL/T.)  NO   RTCOMPATIBILITY
                            turns the CTRL/R and CTRL/T features on.

        SBELL               Sets the terminal to  ring  the  bell  when
                            output  is  automatically  stopped (this is
                            the default action).  NO  SBELL  suppresses
                            the bell.

        SLAVE               Specifies that the terminal becomes slaved,
                            so  that  no  commands  can be typed on the
                            terminal.  This  is  useful  for  terminals
                            that  are  ASSIGNed  by  another job.  This
                            command  is  not  recommended  for  use  by
                            non-privileged  users  because  the actions
                            can be reversed only by an operator  [1,2],
                            using NO SLAVE.

        SPEED m n           Sets the terminal transmitting speed  to  m
                            and  the  receiving speed to n.  To set the
                            same transmitting and receiving speed,  use
                            the  m argument alone.  You must adjust the
                            speed of your terminal to  match  m  and  n

                            using switches on your terminal.

                            NO SPEED is an invalid argument.

                                               NOTE

                                Certain hardware configurations  do
                                not   allow  transmit  and  receive
                                speeds to be different (also called
                                "split speed").


        SSTOP               Ignores  CTRL/Q  until  output  is  stopped
                            either by the system (automatically), or by
                            CTRL/S from user.

        STOP                Stops output to the terminal  automatically
                            after  n  lines  (where n is page length --
                            see the LENGTH argument).   When  you  type
                            CTRL/Q, the page length counter is reset to
                            0.

        TAB                 Specifies that this terminal  has  hardware
                            TAB stops every eight columns.  The default
                            is set according to the  declared  terminal
                            type.   When  you  use  NO TAB, the monitor
                            simulates tabs  by  sending  the  necessary
                            number of SPACE characters.

        TAPE                Controls the function of CTRL/S and CTRL/Q.
                            TAPE  causes  CTRL/S  to function like XOFF
                            and  CTRL/Q  to  function  like  XON   when
                                                                _______                            reading  paper  tape.   Refer  the  TOPS-10

                            CTRL/S  and  CTRL/Q  to  take  their normal
                            function.   Refer  to  Sections  1.5.7  and
                            1.5.8.

        TERMINET            Sets   tab   spacing   identical    to    a
                            TERMINET-300.

        TIDY                Specifies (for Model 2741  terminals)  that
                            every  character  occupy  one  print space.
                            The terminal normally prints characters  so
                            that  they appear the same as you type them
                            in.  For example, [ prints as ^<.  In  TIDY
                            mode, [ prints as <.

        TYPE nnnn           Sets terminal  characteristics  defined  by
                            the declared terminal type (nnnn).

                            The following terminal types are recognized

                            been declared.  The characteristics set for
                            these types are described in Table 2-2.

                            The  characteristics  that   are   set   by
                            declaring the terminal type are:

                                 LOWERCASE
                                 TABS

                            TYPE is not  a  necessary  portion  of  the
                            command  string.   For example, you can set
                            your terminal type to that of an  LA120  by
                            typing SET TTY LA120.

        UC                  Equivalent to SET TTY  NO  LC.   Translates
                            all  lowercase letters to uppercase.  NO UC
                            is equivalent to SET TTY LC.

        WIDTH n             Sets the terminal width (the length of  the
                            line)   to   n  characters.   This  command
                            combined with  the  SET  TTY  CRLF  command
                            enables  you to specify the widest possible
                            margin  for  your  terminal.   The  default
                            setting   is  determined  by  the  declared
                            terminal type.

        XONXOF              Allows you to use CTRL/S to stop output  to
                            the   terminal.    This   is  the  default.
                            NOXONOF  prevents  CTRL/S   from   stopping
                            output.
