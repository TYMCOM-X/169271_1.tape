Ken,
     It would be really helpful to me if you could track and report
actual hours on the monthly status reports.  Stuart expects that kind of
a breakdown from me -- I input everyone's hours into a spreadsheet so I
can produce some statistics.  (I guess I need to circulate my report as
well as the NTD reports.)  Thanks for your cooperation.

Subject: Ontyme file transfer? 

I just (8-Oct) got a message from FSC.SUP saying something about file
transfer from PDP-X to the FSC Ontyme account using a file called:
  ACCESS.ONT  which contains

  username;EMSFSC
  ACCOUNT.FSC
  ONTYME NAME F/LastName

Do you know anything about anything that would use such a mechanism?
/Carl

Subject:  ISIS Dispatcher changes
 
==============================================================================
 
The latest version of ISIS (version 7.00), which will be released to Baseline
this January, contains a change in the Dispatcher interface that anyone who
writes code under ISIS should be aware of.
 
The new Dispatcher checks to make sure that slots do not try to output an
illegal message on a port that is in login state.  Login state applies to
normal circuits being built out and is the time between the receipt of the
Pseudo-Needle message (type B2) and the receipt of the Login OK (type B6) or
Login Failed message (type B5).  The only messages that can legally be sent
during this time are Logon Char (B3), Zapper (9F), Detach (9E), Zap w/Reason
(BE), Backpressure On (A0), and Backpressure Off (A1).  An attempt to send
any other message will cause the slot to be crashed with a Dispatcher Crash.
 
The new Dispatcher also makes the reverse check.  It will crash a slot that
attempts to send a Logon Char message (B3) on a port that is not in logon
state.
 
This is NOT a protocol change; these rules have always been in effect, but
the old Dispatcher did not enforce them.  There are still some slot programs
that violate these rules, but have gotten away with it up to now.  Please
make sure that your code follows the above rules.  You can use ISIS version
7.00 from the Betatest directory to help.  This way we can all avoid a lot
of pain in January.

=============================================================================
 
The ISIS Development Unit would like to make a change to the local clocks
array in segment F (pointed to by location F001C) used to time slot CPU
usage.  If you know of any slot code other than SLURP that uses this array,
please let me know.  I am at extension 8140 or Ontyme NTD.DS.

To:       ISG Lists A - E

Subject:  ONTYME SYSTEMS APPOINTMENT



I am pleased to announce the appointment of Richard C. Gunther 
to the position of General Manager, Ontyme Systems, in the newly 
formed McDonnell Douglas Electronic Messaging Systems Company 
(MDEMS, a part of Network Systems Company).  Dick will report to 
Terry Donaher, Vice President, MDEMS.

Dick brings over 25 years of experience in the computing and 
communications industries to MDEMS.  Over the past four years, 
he has made many contributions to the strategic plans of Tymnet 
and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group, most 
recently by chairing the ISG Communications Opportunities Task 
Force and by spearheading the effort to create MDEMS.  He was 
instrumental in the acquisition of FTC Communications, the other 
principal component of MDEMS.

During the balance of 1985, Dick will focus on developing a 1986 
operating plan for Ontyme Systems, and organizing the business 
unit to start the new year with increased momentum.

The recent announcement of the formation of MDEMS stressed that 
a key to ISG's success will be how well MDEMS works with all the 
other business units to distribute its products and services.  
Dick is making this his top priority.  Please join me in 
welcoming him to MDEMS and give him your full support in his 
efforts to achieve our mutual objectives.
