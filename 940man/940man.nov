                               THE XDS 940 - TYMCOM-IX
                               -----------------------

      A.       THE XDS 940 SYSTEM IS A GENERAL PURPOSE DIGITAL COMPUTER
           THAT IS DESIGNED FOR LARGE SCALE, TIME-SHARING  COMPUTING APPLICATIONS.
           THERE ARE SPECIAL FEATURES THAT ENABLE THE 940 TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS
           OF A TIME-SHARING SYSTEM. THESE FEATURES ARE : 1) MONITOR AND USER MODES
          OF OPERATION. 2) "MEMORY MAP" WHICH LETS A MONITOR-MODE PROGRAM
          AND DYNAMICALLY RELOCATE MEMORY AND OPERATE USER-MODE PROGRAMS
          WITHIN SCATTERED FRAGMENTS OF MEMORY. 3) "SYS POP'S" OR SYSTEM PROGRAMMED
          OPERATORS, ARE SINGLE-WORD, INSTRUCTION-FORMAT,DIRECT ENTRANCE TO VARIOUS
          SERVICE ROUTINES. 4) "INTERRUPTS", ASSURES THAT NO PROGRAM CAN "HANG UP"
          THE COMPUTER THROUGH THE IMPROPER EXECUTION OF AN INFINITE INDIRECT
          ADDRESS CHAIN OR INFINITE EXECUTE INSTRUCTION SEQUENCE.

                    
                    THE TYMSHARE 940 SYSTEM CONFIGURATION IS AS FOLLOWS.

      B.  1) XDS 940 COMPUTER,WHICH INCLUDES A BUILT IN TIME MULTEPLEXED
             COMMUNICATION CHANNEL (TMCC) WITH TWO LEVELS OF PRIORITY INTERRUPTS.

          2) MEMORY INTERLACE CONTROL UNIT FOR BUILT IN TMCC.

          3) FOUR 16,384-WORD CORE MEMORY MODULES.

          4)MULTIPLE ACCESS TO MEMORY UNIT FOR EACH MEMORY MODULE.

          5) DIRECT-ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL (DACC) WITH TWO LEVELS OF PRIORITY.

          6) TWO RAPID-ACCESS DISC (RAD)

          7) CAL COM 215 DISK DRIVES.  EACH PACK CONTAINS 50 MILLION
             CHARACTERS OF STORAGE.  USUALLY THERE ARE AT LEAST 2 AND POSSIBLY
             4 PACKS PERS SYSTEM.  A FEW SYSTEMS USE DATA PRODUCTS DISK FILE
             INSTEAD.  THESE WERE "ORIGINIAL EQUIPMENT" AND CONTAIN 64
             MILLION CHARACTERS OF STORAGE.  ONLY ONE OF THESE PER SYSTEM.

          8) TWO MAGNETIC TAPE TRANSPORTS (7 TRACK)

          9) REAL-TIME CLOCK, WITH TWO LEVELS OF PRIORITY INTERRUPT

         10) VARIAN DATA 620I/L (TYMSAT) WHICH IS A COMMUNICATION CONTROLLER

         11) PRINTER AND CARD READER *NOTE ALL TYMSHARE SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE A
             PRINTER AND CARD READER AND CARD PUNCH.

         12) DATA PRODUCTS DISC CONTROLLER FOR THOSE SYSTEM WHICH HAVE A 5045 DISC FILE.

         13) MEMORY INTERFACE CONNECTIONS (MIC)- A GENERAL INTERFACE BETWEEN THE
             COMPUTER AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD WHICH ALLOWS SPECIAL DEVICES (TYMSATS) TO
             CONNECTED TO THE COMPUTER.


         C.                  THE 940 OPERATOR CONTROL PANEL

                THE 940 CONTROL PANEL CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO THE CENTRAL PROCESSOR (CPU)

           1) POWER- THIS SWITCH TURNS THE COMPUTER POWER SYSTEM ON OR OFF, AND IS
             LIGHTED WHEN IN THE ON CONDITION

           2) I/O DISPLAY SELECT, EIGHT POSITION,THUMBWHEEL SWITCH SELECTS THE
              THE CHANNEL WHICH THE UNIT ADDRESS AND ERROR INDICATORS ARE DISPLAYED
              IN THE INPUT-OUTPUT LIGHTS.
         
           3) FILL-OPERATOR HAS THE OPTION OF FOUR INPUT MEDIA TO INITIALLY LOAD OR (FILL)
              THE COMPUTER, THESE OPTIONS ARE PAPER TAPE, MAG TAPE, CARDS AND DRUM

           4) OVERFLOW-THIS INDICATOR DISPLAYS THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE OVERFLOW INDICATOR

           5) HALT- THIS INDICATOR DISPLAYS THE CURRENT STATUS OF  THE HALT FLIP-FLOP.
             BY PLACING THE RUN/IDLE/STEP SWITCH IN IDLE,CLEARS THE HALT
             FLIP-FLOP AND TURNS OFF THE HALT INDICATOR.

           6) INTERRUPT ENABLED- THIS INDICATOR IS ON IF THE SYSTEM IS ENABLED AND OFF
              IF THE SYSTEM IS DISABLED. THE SWITCH SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN THE COMPUTER POSITION.

           7)MEMORY PARITY-WHEN A PARITY ERROR IS ENCOUNTER THE MEMORY PARITY
              INDICATOR WILL BE ON, AT THIS POINT THE SYSTEM WILL BE IN THE IDLE STATE.

           8) INPUT-OUTPUT- THE UNIT LIGHTS CONTAIN THE INPUT/OUTPUT UNIT ADDRESS
             OF THE PERIPHERAL DEVICE CURRENTLY CONNECTED TO THE SELECTED CHANNEL.
             THE ERROR LIGHT REFLECTS THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE CHANNEL ERROR
             INDICATOR. THE SWITCH SELECTS THE CHANNEL TO BE DISPLAYED.

           9)  MEMORY EXTENSION-  THERE ARE TWO MEMORY EXTENSION INDICATORS. THE LEFT
             INDICATOR IS LIGHTED WHEN EXTEND MEMORY REGISTER EM3 DOES NOT CONTAIN
             THE VALUE 3. THE RIGHT MEMORY INDICATOR IS LIGHTED WHEN EXTEND MEMORY
             REGSITER EM2 DOES NOT CONTAIN THE VALUE 2.

          10) PROGRAM LOCATION-  CONSISTS OF 14 BINARY INDICATORS THAT SHOW THE
               THE CURRENT CONTENTS OF THE "P" REGISTER. WHEN THE SYSTEM  IS IN THE IDLE
             STATE THE INDICATORS CONTAIN THE VIRTUAL ADDRESS OF THE NEXT INSTRUCTION
             TO BE EXECUTED.

          11) START-   THIS SWITCH IS USED TO INITIALIZE THE NORMAL MODE OF THE COMPUTER.
             WHEN PRESSED IT WILL RESET ALL CHANNEL REGISTERS AND INDICATORS TO ZERO.

          12) HOLD  WHEN THE HOLD SWITCH IS IN THE DOWN POSITION, THE "P" REGISTER
             IS AUTOMATICALLY INCREMENTED BY 1 AS EACH INSTRUCTION IS EXECUTED.
             WHEN THE HOLD SWITCH IS IN THE UP POSITION THE CURRENT CONTENTS OF THE
             "P" REGISTER IS HELD AND PREVINTED FROM COUNTING.

          13) REGISTER DISPLAY  CONSISTS OF 24 BINARY INDICATORS (THE 940 IS A 24 BIT 
              WORD COMPUTER PLUS A PARITY BIT) THAT SHOW THE CONTENTS OF THE REGISTER SELECTED
              BY THE REGISTER SWITCH.

          14) CLEAR  PRESSING THE CLEAR PUSHBUTTON CLEARS THE SELECTED REGISTER
             TO ALL ZEROS.

          15) REGISTER  FOUR POSITION, ROTARY SWITCH SELECTS THE INTERNAL REGISTER TO 
             BE DISPLAYED. THE SELECTABLE REGISTERS ARE:

                               C REGISTER(ARITHMETIC AND CONTROL)
                               A '      '(MAIN ACCUMULATOR)
                               B '       '(EXTENDED ACCUMULATOR)
                               X '       '(INDEX)

         
          16) MEMORY CLEAR   THESE TWO SWITCHES ARE USED TO CLEAR THE FIRST 16K OF 
              CORE MEMORY TO ZEROS.

          17) BREAKPOINT    USED IN NORMAL-MODE OR MONITOR-MODE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE 
              FOUR SWITCHES. SEE TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR WRITEUP ON BREAKPOINTS.

          18) RUN-IDLE-STEP  THREE-POSITION, TOGGLE SWITCH WHICH HAS TWO STATIONARY POSITION
              RUN/IDLE AND A SPRING-LOADED, MOMENTARY POSITION (STEP)

                               RUN INSTRUCTION ARE EXECUTED AUTOMATICALLY AT COMPUTER SPEED

                               IDLE-THE COMPUTER "IDLES" IMMEDIATELY AFTER OBTAINING AN
                                    INSTRUCTION FROM MEMORY.

                               STEP-CAUSES THE COMPUTER TO EXECUTE THE CURRENT CONTENTS OF
                                    THE 'C' REGISTER.

                               DESELECTING 16K (1 DOOR)
                               ------------------------

PURPOSE: TO ELIMINATE A KNOWN OR SUSPECTED BAD DOOR FROM THE RUNNING CONFIGURATION.

GENERAL: THE TYMSHARE MONITOR HAS THE ABILITY TO OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY, ALTHOUGH AT A LOSS
         OF SPEED, ON 48K OF MEMORY (3 DOORS,1DOOR=16K) INSTEAD OF 64K OR 4 DOORS.
         THIS ALLOWS US TO TIMESHARE A SYSTEM WITH ONE DOOR ELIMINATED FROM THE NORMAL
         CONFIGURATION UNTIL TIME IS AVAILABLE TO REPAIR THE 4TH DOOR. THE "COMPUTE
         WHILE SWAP" INSTRUCTION IS SUSPENDED AT THIS TIME.

PROCEDURE:
             (A)  CHECK WITH THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER TO SEE THAT THE DOOR YOU WISH TO 
                  ELIMINATE OR "SWAP OUT" IS CABLED UP AS THE 4TH DOOR AND THAT THE SYSTEM
                  IS OUT OF INTER-LEAVING. RUNNING IN INTER-LEAVING WILL CAUSE THE MONITOR
                  TO USE ONLY THE FIRST 48K BUT STILL ACCESS THE 4TH DOOR.

             (B)  FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO BRING UP THE SYSTEM ON 3 DOORS:

                  (1) IDLE
                  (2) START
                  (3) ALL BREAKPOINTS UP
                  (4) RUN
                  (5) MAG-TAPE FILL TO RUN DSWAP
                  (6) WAIT FOR HALT
                  (7) SET BREAKPOINTS FOR DESIRED DISC FROM WHICH YOU WISH TO SWAP IN THE MONITOR
                  (8) TOGGLE RUN
                  (9) WAIT FOR HALT (25 SHOULD BE IN THE P COUNTER)
                 (10) ALL BREAKPOINTS UP
                 (11) SET BREAKPOINT 2 (BRING UP ON 3 DOORS)
                 (12) TOGGLE RUN
                 (13) ALL BREAKPOINTS UP


              AT THIS POINT THE OPERATOR SHOULD FOLLOW THE NORMAL PROCEDURE




               WHAT TO DO WHEN TYMSHARE MAINTENANCE RETURNS A SYSTEM
               -----------------------------------------------------


     WHEN THE C.E. PERFORMS SCHEDULED P.M. IT WILL BE STANDARD OPERATION PROCEDURE
     TO RUN-OFF LINE DIAGNOSTICS, BRING THE TIME-SHARING SYSTEM UP AND RUN ON-LINE
     DIAGNOSTICS. THE OPERATOR SHOULD BE COMPLETELY SATISFIED THAT THE SYSTEM
     IS RUNNING PROPERLY BEFORE CUSTOMERS ARE ALLOWED TO USE THE SYSTEM.


     IN CASE A PROBLEM OCCURS IN THE NEXT DAY OR  TWO, IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
    THAT ALL WORK PERFORMED BY THE C.E. IS NEATLY  WRITTEN IN THE LOG BOOK BY THE SHIFT SUPERVISOR
     FOR EASY REFERENCE. HE SHOULD BE EXPLICIT IN WRITING ENTRYS (E.G. RAN DIAGNOSTICS
     REPLACED MODULES, DISC ARMS, ETC.) IT SHOULD BE THE BUSINESS OF ALL OPERATORS
     TO  KNOW  EXACTLY WHAT THE STATUS OF ALL COMPUTERS ARE AT THE TIME THEY BEGIN
     THEIR SHIFT.

     *NOTE BEFORE A SHIFT SUPERVISOR TURNS A SYSTEM OVER TO THE C.E. HE
     SHOULD TAKE ALL THE PRECAUTION NECESSARY TO INSURE THAT ALL
     CUSTOMER AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION CAN BE RESTORED, SHOULD ANY PROBLEMS ARISE
     OF A C.E. OR SYSTEM ERROR.


















                               940 MEMORY PARITY PROCEDURE
                               ---------------------------

                    PROCEDURE:
      1. IF THE SYSTEM CRASHES WITH P=76, THIS DENOTES THAT THE CPU MADE
         AN ACCESS TO MEMORY AND FOUND THE PARITY BIT (M24) TO BE INCORRECT.

         THE SOFTWARE WILL ALLOW 4 PARITIES TO OCCUR, BUT ONLY IN USER MODE, BEFORE
         THE SYSTEM WILL CRASH.

         IF A MEMORY PARITY OCCURS WHEN MONITOR RELABELING IS INVOKED,
         THE SYSTEM WILL CRASH IMMEDIATELY. (BIT 0 OF THE FETCHED WORD IS A 1)

      2. IF THE SYSTEM CRASHES WITH P=100, THIS DENOTES THAT AN I/O PARITY
         HAS BEEN DETECTED WHILE THE TMCC, MIC, OR THE DACC WAS ACCESSING MEMORY.
         (DATA TRANSFER FROM MEMORY TO A DEVICE)

      3. IF THE PARITY LIGHT IS ON, THIS INDICATES THAT EITHER THE MEMORY PARITY
         OPTION IS REMOVED OR THAT A PARITY OCCURRED WHILE PROCESSING A PARITY INTERRUPT.

      4. WHENEVER A PARITY CRASH OCCURS, PERFORM THE FOLLOWING:

      A.    ALLOW XDS TO DETERMINE IF PARITY EXISTS IN CORE.
      B.    SET ALL INTERLEAVING SWITCHES UP. THEY ARE LOCATED IN THE LEFT
         REAR DOOR OF THE CPU. WHEN THE SWITCHES ARE UP, THE MEMORIES ARE OUT OF
         INTERLEAVING. PERFORMING THIS FUNCTION WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO ISOLATE
         THE PROBLEM IF ANOTHER PARITY OCCURS. MAKE SURE THAT ALL SWITCHES ARE PLACED UP.
         IF THIS IS NOT DONE, THE SYSTEM WILL NOT COME UP.

      C. BRING UP THE SYSTEM
      D. IF THE CRASH HAS BEEN SAVED, RECOVER THE MONITOR SYMBOL TABLE:

         REC   *1MONST

         PLACE THE CRASH IN CORE:

         PLA   XXFILE

         TYPE: CON      THIS WILL PUT YOU IN DDT.

         TYPE: IOP[   XXXXX C.R.

               CPUP[  XXXXX C.R

               CPC[  XXXXX C.R.

               RRL3[  XXXXXX C.R.

               T3[  XXXXXX C.R.

               RAWORK[ C.R.

               RABOL[  C.R.



      RECORD THESE LOCATIONS IN THE SYSTEM LOG.

      IOP    MARK LOCATION FOR I/O PARITY INTERRUPT ROUTINE.

      CPUP   MARK LOCATION OF MEMORY PARITY INTERRUPT ROUTINE. IF
             THE SIGN BIT OF (BIT 0) THIS WORD IS A (1) THEN MONITOR RELABELING
             WAS INVOLVED. THUS, THE ADDRESS OF THE PARITY MUST BE CACULATED USING

                               PROCEDURE FOLLOWING POWER FAILURE
                               ---------------------------------

WHEN A POWER FAILURE OCCURS THE MAIN BREAKER LOCATED IN THE POWER ROOM
WILL TRIP AND SHUT OFF ALL POWER TO THE BUILDING AND COMPUTERS. AT THIS
TIME THE BATTERY OPERATED EMERGENCY LIGHTS WILL FUNCTION. TO ORDERLY
RESTORE THE POWER TO THE BUILDING AND COMPUTERS WITHOUT CAUSING MAJOR
HARDWARE PROBLEMS FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE.

1.  SHUT OFF SECONDARY BREAKERS TO SYSTEMS AREAS.

2.  CHECK TO SEE THAT POWER HAS RETURNED TO THE METER. (LIGHTS INSIDE
    METER SHOULD BE ON).

3.  IF POWER HAS RETURNED TO THE METER RESET THE MAIN BREAKER. THIS WILL
   RETURN POWER TO THE LIGHTING AND AIR CONDITIONING.

4.  BE SURE THE ARMS ON THE DATA PRODUCTS DISKS HAVE BEEN PULLED BACK.
    (TYMSHARE MAINTENANCE WILL PERFORM THIS TASK).

5.  WHEN ALL DISKS ARE READY POWER UP THE SECONDARY BREAKERS ONE AT
    A TIME IN ORDER.

6.  AGAIN CHECK THE DISKS TO BE SURE THEY ARE ON LINE AND UP TO SPEED.

7.  CHECK TO SEE THAT ALL TYMBASES AND SELECTOR CHANNELS ARE RUNNING
    PROPERLY.

8.  BRING UP THE COMPUTERS USING STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES. NO
    NEED TO SAVE THE CRASH SINCE A POWER FAILURE OCCURRED.
    NOTE: AT TIMES ON THE FIRST BRINGUP AFTER A POWER FAILURE THE
    SYSTEM WILL GO TO P=76 (MEMORY PARITY). WHEN THIS OCCURS, CLEAR
    MEMORY AND TRY AGAIN TO BRING UP THE SYSTEM. AFTER SEVERAL TRYS
    CONTACT TYMSHARE MAINTENANCE AND YOUR SHIFT SUPERVISOR.

9.  ENTER PROPER CODE (50) INTO EACH SYSTEM LOG.

10. NOTIFY YOUR SUPERVISOR OR LEAD OPERATOR IF ANY PROBLEMS OCCUR OR
    WHEN YOUR SYSTEMS COME UP.
                               THE 1COUNT PROGRAM
                               ------------------


PURPOSE: TO GIVE PERTINENT INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO THE CURRENT
         OPERATING SYSTEM.

              TOPOLOGY AND NETWORK PERFORMANCE


      THERE ARE THREEE CONFIGURATIONS ALLOWED BY THE CURRENT SOFTWARE;
A BASE, A FIELD REMOTE, AND AN OPERATORS REMOTE.

      A BASE IS CONNECTED TO A 940 AND CAN HAVE UP TO FOUR SYNCHRONOUS
LINES ATTACHED TO IT, ONE OF WHICH CAN BE 4800 BITS PER SECOND. WITHOUT
A 201 CARD, THE BASE CAN HAVE ONLY TWO LINES, BOTH OF WHICH MUST BE
2400 BPS; IT CANNOT DRIVE ANY LOW SPEED ASYCHRONOUS LINES.

      THERE IS ONE 940 FOR EACH BASE, AND ONE BASE FOR EACH 940. EACH
940 HAS 42 PORTS WHICH ARE SERVED BY ITS BASE. EACH PORT IS ONE END OF A
FULL DUPLEX "CIRCUIT", THE OTHER END OF WHICH TERMINATES IN A PORT IN A
REMOTE 620. IN ADDITION TO THE 42 CIRCUITS WHICH TERMINATE IN A BASE, UP
TO 44 MAY PASS THROUGH IT.

      A FIELD REMOTE CAN HAVE ONE 2400 BPS SYNCHRONOUS LINE WITHOUT A 
201 CARD; OR THREE LINES WITH A CARD, ONE OF WHICH CAN BE 4800 BPS.
A FIELD REMOTE CAN DRIVE UP TO 31 LOW SPEED ASYNCHRONOUS LINES AT 
RATES UP TO 300 BAUD. THESE PORTS ARE NORMALLY CONNECTED TO 103 DATASETS.
UP TO 49 CIRCUITS CAN PASS THROUGH A FIELD REMOTE.

      AN OPERATOR'S  REMOTE IS A SPECIAL CONFIGURATION FOR THE NATIONAL
COMPUTER CENTER. THIS REMOTE DIFFERS FROM A FIELD REMOTE BY HAVING NO
2741 CAPABILITY AND ALLOWING UP TO FIVE SYNCHRONOUS LINES. ONE LINE MAY
BE EITHER 1200 OR 2400 BPS, BUT THE OTHER FOUR MUST BE 1200 BPS.

      A 2400 BPS LINE CAN PASS APPROXIMATELY 240 CHARACTERS PER SECOND,
ENOUGH FOR 40 CIRCUITS. A 4800 BPS LINE CAN HANDLE 80 CIRCUITS, OR TWO 940
LOADS LESS OPERATOR CIRCUITS (CTE CHANNELS 0 AND 1).

 *NODE DESCRIPTOR FORMAT
 *620 CELL LAYOUT
 *BUFFER LAYOUT
 *SUPERVISORY RECORDS
 *SPECIAL MESSAGE RECORDS
 *LOGIN SEQUENCE
 *CIRCUIT ZAPPER EFFECTS

*NODE DESCRIPTOR FORMAT

   EVERY NODE IN THE NET IS DESCRIBED BY A NODE DESCRIPTOR. THESE 
DESCRIPTORS FORM A MULTILINKED LIST STRUCTURE OCCUPYING SEVERAL
PAGES OF MEMORY OF WHICH ONLY ONE IS LABLED IN AT A TIME. PAGE 6
IS USED AS A WINDOW TO CONTAIN THE LABLED IN PAGE.
   BITS 0 THROUGH 5 OF THE FIRST CELL CONTAIN THE VERSION NUMBER
OF THE SOFTWARE IN THE NODE. BITS 6 THROUGH 17 ARE THE
NODE NUMBER. 18 THROUGH 20 ARE THE NUMBER OF PORT ARRAYS FOR THE NODE.
THIS NUMBER WILL NORMALLY BE 1. IF THERE ARE 2 940S ON A BASE
OR IF THERE ARE EXTRA SETS OF SPECIAL DEVICES ON A REMOTE
THIS NUMBER WILL BE MORE THAN 1. BITS 21 THROUGH 23 ARE THE DSWICH
SETTING WHICH IS USED TO ROUTE DOWNSTREAM MESSAGES.
   THE NEXT WORD(S) ARE POINTERS TO LINE DESCRIPTORS.
BITS 3 THROUGH 11 ARE THE DISPLACEMENT WHICH MUST BE ADDED TO THE
ADDRESS OF THE FIRST CELL TO FIND THE ADDRESS OF THE FIRST CELL
OF THE LINE DESCRIPTOR. BITS 12 THROUGH 23 ARE THE NUMBER OF THE
NODE AT THE OTHER END OF THE 201 LINE. THERE IS ONE
OF THESE CELLS (AND ONE LINE DESCRIPTOR) FOR EACH 201 LINE. 
IN BASES, THERE IS ONE EXTRA CELL AND LINE DESCRIPTOR FOR
INTERNAL CONNECTIONS. THE "NODE NUMBER" FOR THIS "LINE" IS ZERO.
NO REAL NODE HAS THE NUMBER ZERO. THE NEXT CELL HAS A 1 IN THE SIGN BIT,
A ZERO NODE NUMBER, AND A DISPLACEMENT POINTING TO THE FIRST CELL
BEYOND THE END OF THE NODE DESCRIPTOR.
   THE NEXT 2 CELLS ARE A BIT MAP FOR BUFFER PAIRS USED FOR PASSING
CIRCUITS THROUGH THE NODE. THEY ARE NUMBERED FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.
A 1 BIT MEANS THE BUFFER PAIR IS IDLE, 0 MEANS IT IS ASSIGNED.
   THE NEXT 2 CELLS ARE A BIT MAP FOR BUFFER PAIRS USED FOR
PORTS. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE SET OF PORTS ON THE
NODE, THERE WILL BE MORE PAIRS OF CELLS USED FOR BIT MAPS.
   THE REST OF THE NODE DESCRIPTOR CONSISTS OF LINE DESCRIPTORS, ONE
FOR EACH 201 LINE. BIT 0 OF THE FIRST WORD IS 1 IF THE LINE
IS DOWN. BITS 1-4 ARE THE SIZE OF THE PERMUTER TABLE DIVIDED BY
16. BITS 5-7 ARE THE LINE NUMBER ON THE OTHER NODE. IF THIS
201 LINE IS THE THIRD LINE ON THE OTHER NODE, BITS 5-7 WILL
CONTAIN A 2. BITS 8-12 ARE THE RELABELING BYTE MINUS 40 OF THE PAGE
CONTAINING THE DESCRIPTOR OF THE NODE AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE.
BITS 13-23 ARE THE INDEX INTO PAGE 6 OF THE OTHER NODE.
   THE NEXT 2 CELLS ARE NUMBERED FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AND ARE THE
UPSTREAM DIRECTION BITS. IF BIT 4, FOR INSTANCE, IS A 1, THAT MEANS
THAT THIS 201 LINE GOES TOWARD HOST NUMBER 4 AND IS TO BE USED
WHEN BUILDING A CIRCUIT TO HOST 4.
   THE REMAINING CELLS ARE ENTRIES IN THE PERMUTER TABLE PACKED
2 PER WORD. THE RIGHTMOST 12 BITS OF THE FIRST CELL ARE FOR
ENTRY NUMBER 2. THE SUPERVISOR DOES NOT NORMALLY MANIPULATE
ENTRY NUMBER 0 AND 1. IF THE 12 BIT BYTE IS ALL ONES, THE CORRESPONDING
CHANNEL IS NOT IN USE AND MAY BE ASSIGNED. WHEN THE CHANNEL IS
IN USE, THE HIGH ORDER BIT IS 1 FOR HIGH SPEED CHANNELS (AUXILLIARY
CIRCUITS AND LINE PRINTERS) AND 0 FOR LOW SPEED CHANNELS (ALL NORMAL
CIRCUITS). THE NEXT 10 BITS DESIGNATE THE BUFFER PAIR WITHIN THE NODE
AND THE LOW ORDER BIT SPECIFIES THE PARTICULAR BUFFER INTO WHICH
CHARACTERS ARE PLACED WHICH COME IN ON THIS CHANNEL (NOTE THAT
INPUT INTO  A HOST MACHINE IS FROM AN EVEN NUMBERED BUFFER AND
OUTPUT TO A TERMINAL IS FROM AN ODD NUMBERED BUFFER).
   BASES HAVE AN EXTRA "LINE DESCRIPTOR" AFTER THE OTHER LINE
DESCRIPTORS FOR MAKING CIRCUITS INTERNAL TO THE BASE. THE
FIRST 3 CELLS ARE CURRENTLY UNASSIGNED. THE REMAINING 8 CELLS
HAVE 16 PERMUTER TABLE ENTRIES WHICH ARE ALWAYS USED IN PAIRS.

*620 CELL LAYOUT

   SEVERAL CELLS IN EACH NODE ARE ASSIGNED ABSOLUTE LOCATIONS.
CELLS 100 THROUGH 104 IN ALL NODES ARE NODE NUMBER, SOFTWARE VERSION
NUMBER, DEBUGGER LOCK, DSWICH, AND CRASH COUNT. THE DEBUGGER
LOCK MUST BE NEGATIVE IF THE SUPERVISOR IS TO WRITE INTO ANY CELL
OTHER THAN 102 THROUGH 201. DSWICH IS USED TO ROUTE DOWNSTREAM 
SUPERVISOR RECORDS. IN REMOTES, ARRAYS OF CELLS FOR 201 LINE STATUS,
NODE NUMBER OF MACHINES AT OTHER END OF 201 LINES, PERMUTER TABLE
ADDRESSES, PERMUTER TABLE SIZES, NUMBER OF GROUPS OF 16 IN
PERMUTER TABLES, INDICES INTO 201 LINE ARRAYS, OUTPUT BEGINING
OF RECORD MARKERS, AND INPUT BEGINING OF RECORD MARKERS BEGIN AT
LOCATIONS 105,110,113,116,121,124,127, AND 132. THE
CORRESPONDING LOCATIONS IN THE BASE ARE 106+2N,113+2N,120+2N,126+2N
134+2N,141+2N,146+2N, AND 153+2N, WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF HOST
MACHINES, HENCE NUMBER OF SETS OF PORTS, ON THAT BASE. CELL 105
CONTAINS NUMBER OF HOST MACHINES AND NUMBER OF 201 LINES. CELLS
106 AND 107 CONTAIN THE NUMBER OF THE FIRST HOST AND ITS UPDOWN
STATUS. CELLS 110 AND 111 ARE FOR THE NEXT HOST, IF ANY.

*BUFFER LAYOUT

   BUFFERS IN NODES ARE ALWAYS ASSIGNED IN PAIRS. THERE ARE NO 
EXCEPTIONS.  IN A BASE THEY ARE ASSIGNED AS FOLLOWS:
THE FIRST 140 OCTAL BUFFERS ARE USED FOR 940 PORTS. EVEN NUMBERED
BUFFERS ARE FOR INPUT INTO THE 940, ODD NUMBERED ARE FOR OUTPUT.
BUFFER NUMBERS 140 TO 151 ARE FOR SUPERVISORY CHANNELS. EVEN NUMBERED
BUFFERS ARE FOR OUTPUT ON THE 201 LINES. 152 THROUGH 163 ARE FOR
FLOW CONTROL. THEY CONTROL THE RATE AT WHICH CHARACTERS MOVE
THROUGH CIRCUITS. 164 THROUGH 311 ARE SPARES USED FOR MAKING
INTERNAL CONNECTIONS AND FOR CIRCUITS PASSING THROUGH THE NODE.
IF THE BASE HAS A SECOND 940 ON IT, THE SECOND 940 WILL USE
BUFFERS 312 THROUGH 451.
   IN REMOTES, BUFFERS 0 THROUGH 77 ARE FOR LOCAL PORTS. ODD NUMBERED
BUFFERS OUTPUT TO THE PORTS. 100 THROUGH 105 ARE SUPERVISORY
BUFFERS, 106 THROUGH 113 ARE FLOW CONTROL BUFFERS, AND 144 THROUGH
253 ARE SPARES. IF THE REMOTE HAS SPECIAL DEVICES REQUIRING MORE
BUFFERS, THEY WILL BE ASSIGNED NUMBERS BEGINNING WITH 254.

*SUPERVISORY RECORDS

   THE SUPERVISOR COMMUNICATES WITH THE LEPRECHAUNS IN RECORDS
48 BITS LONG. IN THE 940, THEY ARE NORMALLY BROKEN UP INTO 3 WORDS
CALLED SR1, SR2, AND SR3 OR STORED INTO THE 3 WORDS OF A BUFFERLET
IN THE LCOM (COMMANDS TO LEPRECHAUNS) LIST. THE INPUT DISPATCHER
GETS INPUT RECORDS FROM THE BASE AND BRANCHES TO 1 OF 8 ROUTINES
TO HANDLE THE VARIOUS RECORD TYPES. ANY ROUTINE WISHING TO
SEND COMMANDS TO A NODE PLACES THESE COMMANDS ON THE LCOM LIST. 
OUTPUTING THESE RECORDS TO THE BASE AND ROUTING THEM THROUGH THE
NET IS DONE BY THE OTROUT ROUTINE. 
   BITS 0 THORUGH 8 OF THE FIRST WORD AND BITS 0 THROUGH 7
OF THE OTHER 2 WORDS ARE ALWAYS ZERO ON INPUT. BIT 0 OF THE
FIRST WORD IS A 1 ON OUTPUT IF AND ONLY IF THE SUPERVISOR
IS ABOUT TO DO A BRS 138 TO BUILD AN AUXILLIARY CIRCUIT INTO
ITSELF. BITS 1 THROUGH 8 OF THE FIRST WORD AND BITS 0 THROUGH 7
OF THE OTHER 2 WORDS ARE NOT USED ON OUTPUT AND MAY BE ANYTHING.
BITS 9 THROUGH 11 ARE THE RECORD TYPE AND BITS 12 THROUGH 23 OF
THE FIRST WORD ARE THE NODE NUMBER FOR ALL RECORDS.

   INPUT RECORD TYPES

   TYPE 0 IS A TAKEOVER RESPONSE. IF SR2 CONTAINS A 555B2, THE
LOW ORDER BITS OF SR2 HAVE THE NUMBER OF THE SUPERVISOR THAT SENT
THE TAKEOVER COMMAND. OTHERWISE, BITS 15 THROUGH 17 OF SR2 ARE
THE NUMBER OF PORT ARRAYS OF THE NODE AND BITS 18 THROUGH 23 ARE
THE NUMBER OF 201 LINES. SR3 CONTAINS THE SOFTWARE VERSION NUMBER.
   TYPE 1 IS A CHARACTER FROM A BUFFER. SR2 IS THE BUFFER NUMBER
AND BITS 16 THROUGH 23 OF SR3 ARE THE RAW ASCII CHARACTER EXACTLY
AS IT WAS RECIEVED FROM THE TERMINAL. THIS RECORD TYPE IS USED
FOR LOGGING IN ONLY.
   TYPE 2 IS A BAD RECORD RETURN. WHEN A LEPRECHAUN GETS A RECORD
THAT IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND, IT COPIES THE FIRST 16 BIT WORD TO
THE THIRD WORD AND SENDS IT BACK AS A TYPE 2. THIS TYPE IS OF 
SIGNIFICANCE ONLY TO SOMEONE DEBUGGING THE NET.
   TYPE 3 HAS 2 USES. IF BIT 8 OF SR2 IS A 0, SR2 IS THE ADDRESS
OF A CELL AND SR3 IS THE CONTENTS OF THAT CELL. OTHERWISE, THIS
IS A SPECIAL MESSAGE RECORD DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT SECTION.
   TYPE 4 IS CURRENTLY UNASSIGNED.
   TYPE 5 IS THE OUTPUT FROM A HOST MACHINE AS DESCRIBED IN @T.
BITS 9-15 IN SR2 ARE THE NUMBER OF THE HOST ON THE BASE (NORMALLY 0
UNLESS THERE IS MORE THAN 1 HOST ON THE BASE). BITS 16-23 ARE THE
PORT NUMBER. BITS 8-15 OF SR3 ARE THE OUTPUT TYPE AND BITS
16-23 ARE THE CONTENTS OF THE CHARACTER POSITION OF THE OUTPUT
ENTITY.
   TYPES 6 AND 7 ARE UNASSIGNED.

   OUTPUT RECORD TYPES

   TYPE 0 IS A TAKEOVER COMMAND. WORD 2 IS 555B2 PLUS THE
SUPERVISOR NUMBER.
   TYPE 1 IS A CHARACTER PAIR. WORD 2 IS THE BUFFER NUMBER INTO
WHICH TO PLACE THE CHARACTERS AND WORD 3 IS THE CHARACTER PAIR.
THE LEFT CHARACTER IS THE FIRST ONE. THESE 8 BIT CHARACTERS
ARE INJECTED DIRECTLY INTO THE CHARACTER STREAM OF A CIRCUIT AND
MUST THEREFORE FOLLOW TYMNET CONVENTIONS. TO AVOID PUTTING
OUT THE SPECIAL CONTROL CHARACTERS 0 THROUGH 7 WHEN
PUTTING OUT ASCII TEXT, IT IS A GOOD PRECAUTION TO MRG IN
200B TO ALL CHARACTERS.
   TYPE 2 IS A COMMAND TO CHANGE A PERMUTER TABLE ENTRY.
BITS 10 THROUGH 13 SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF THE PERMUTER TABLE
AND BITS 14 THROUGH 23 OF THE SECOND WORD SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF
THE ENTRY IN THAT TABLE. THE THIRD WORD
IS THE NEW ENTRY. NOTE THAT THE 620 IS A 16 BIT MACHINE SO A 12 BIT
BYTE IN A NODE DESCRIPTOR PERMUTER TABLE CORRESPONDS TO A 16 BIT
BYTE IN A 620 PERMUTER TABLE. THE RIGHT MOST 11 BITS ARE THE SAME.
THE LEFTMOST BIT IS ALSO THE SAME. THE EXTRA 4 BITS IN THE 620 ARE
ZERO EXCEPT IN THE SPECIAL CASE OF A NULL ENTRY, IN WHICH CASE
ALL 16 BITS ARE ONES.
   TYPE 3 IS A CHANGE CELL COMMAND IF BIT 8 OF THE SECOND WORD IS
A 0. OTHERWISE IT IS A SPECIAL MESSAGE RECORD DESCRIBED IN THE
NEXT SECTION. A CHANGE CELL COMMAND HAS THE ADDRESS OF THE CELL
TO BE CHANGED IN THE SECOND WORD AND THE NEW CONTENTS IN THE THIRD
WORD. THE SUPERVISOR CAN WRITE INTO CELLS 102 THROUGH 201
ANY TIME, BUT MUST SET CELL 102 TO A NEGATIVE NUMBER BEFORE IT CAN
WRITE INTO ANY OTHER CELL.
   TYPE 4 IS A REQUEST FOR THE CONTENTS OF 2 CELLS. WORDS 2 AND 3
ARE THE ADDRESSES OF THE 2 CELLS.
   TYPE 5 IS FOR SPECIAL INPUT INTO A HOST. BITS 9-15 OF WORD 2
ARE THE NUMBER OF THE HOST ON THE BASE (WILL BE 0 UNLESS THERE
ARE 2 HOSTS ON ONE BASE) AND BITS 16-23 OF WORD 2 ARE THE PORT NUMBER.
BITS 8-15 OF WORD 3 ARE THE INPUT TYPE NUMBER AS DOCUMENTED IN
@T AND BITS 16-23 ARE THE CHARACTER POSITION OF THE INPUT COMMAND.
BIT 8 OF WORD 2 IS A 1 IF THE NEXT SEVERAL CHARACTERS ARE TO BE
SENT TO THE SUPERVISOR.
   TYPES 6 AND 7 ARE UNASSIGNED.

*SPECIAL MESSAGE RECORDS

   TYPE 3 RECORDS WITH BIT 8 OF THE SECOND WORD EQUAL TO 1 ARE
USED FOR SPECIAL MESSAGES. BITS 18-23 OF THE SECOND WORD SPECIFY
THE SPECIAL MESSAGE SUBTYPE. THEY WILL BE DESCRIBED BELOW BY
SUBTYPE NUMBER.
  
   INPUT

0: CIRCUIT ZAPPER STARTED. SR3 IS THE BUFFER NUMBER INTO WHICH
THE CIRCUIT ZAPPER WAS RELEASED.
1: PERMUTER TABLE ENTRY MADE. SR3 IS THE ENTRY THAT WAS MADE (THE
NEW CONTENTS OF THE PERMUTER TABLE CELL).
2: 940 UPDOWN. SR3 CONTAINS THE 940 NUMBER. BIT 8 OF SR3 IS 1 IF
THE 940 JUST WENT DOWN AND 0 IF THE 940 JUST CAME UP.
3: BUFFER ZAPPED. THE 620 RAN OUT OF BUFFER SPACE AND CLEARED ITS
LARGEST BUFFER TO MAKE MORE ROOM. SR3 IS THE BUFFER NUMBER.
4: LINE RESET. SR3 IS THE NUMBER OF THE LINE THAT JUST RESET.
5: NO DATA. SR3 IS THE NUMBER OF THE 201 LINE THAT RECIEVED NO
PHYSICAL RECORDS FOR 16 SECONDS.
6: LINE ERRORS. SR3 IS THE NUMBER OF THE 201 LINE THAT RECIEVED
MANY CHECKSUM ERRORS IN THE LAST 256 SECONDS. "MANY" IS USUALLY
DEFINED TO MEAN MORE THAN 40 DECIMAL. BITS 8 THROUGH 17 OF SR3
ARE THE NUMBER OF ERRORS.
7: 940 UNHAPPY. SR3 IS A NONZERO 16 BIT PATTERN READ OUT OF A HOST
INDICATING SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE HOST. THE MEANING OF THESE
BITS WILL VARY FROM HOST TO HOST AND MONITOR TO MONITOR.

   OUTPUT

0: OUTPUT MESSAGE TO PORT(TO REMOTES ONLY). BITS 21-23
OF THE THIRD WORD SPECIFY WHICH OF 7 MESSAGES STORED IN
THE REMOTE TO OUTPUT ON A PORT. A 0 MEANS NO MESSAGE.
A TENTATIVE LIST OF MESSAGES IS
0) NO MESSAGE
1) PLEASE LOG IN:
2) ERROR, TYPE USER NAME:
3) ERROR, TYPE PASSWORD:
4) USER NAME:
5) PASSWORD:
6) PROJECT CODE:
7) UNASSIGNED
   BIT 8 OF THE THIRD WORD WILL BE 1 IF THE INPUT BUFFER IS
TO BE CLEARED, BIT 9 WILL BE 1 IF THE ECHO IS TO BE ON, 0 IF
IT IS TO BE OFF. ALL OF THESE MESSAGES WILL REENABLE LOGGIN MODE.
THAT IS, THEY WILL ALLOW CHARACTERS FROM THE TERMINAL TO GO TO
THE SUPERVISOR.
   BITS 13-20 OF THE THIRD WORD ARE THE PORT NUMBER.
0: GET TIME(BASES ONLY). SENT BY SUPERVISORY TO (USUALLY) ITS OWN
BASE TO FIND OUT WHAT TIME IT IS.
1: TURN SPEAKER ON( BASES ONLY). SOUND THE SPEAKER TO GET THE

*LOGIN SEQUENCE

   THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL LOGIN SEQUENCE TO ILLUSTRATE
SOME OF THE MACHINARY INVOLVED. A USER NAMED FRED CALLS A TELEPHONE
ROTARY ATTACHED TO A REMOTE. WHEN THE REMOTE DETECTS BOTH CARRIER
PRESENCE AND DATA SET READY ON THE DATA SET, IT SENDS A MESSAGE
AT 110 BAUD TO ASK FRED TO IDENTIFY HIS TERMINAL. FRED TYPES A
CHARACTER AND THE REMOTE SETS UP THE APPROPRIATE TERMINAL
PARAMETERS AND SENDS THE CHARACTER TO THE SUPERVISOR. IT ALSO
SENDS FRED A PLEASE LOG IN MESSAGE. WHEN THE SUPERVISOR GETS THE
CHARACTER IT SCANS THE LOGIN LIST TO SEE IF ANYONE IS CURRENTLY
LOGGING IN  ON THAT PORT OF THAT 620. WHEN IT FINDS NO ENTRY, IT
DEDUCES THAT THIS IS A NEW PERSON. IT MAKES AN ENTRY ON THE LOGIN
LIST AND A TIMEOUT ENTRY ON THE TIMEOUT LIST. IT SAVES IN
THE ENTRY ON THE LOGIN LIST THE NODE NUMBER AND PORT NUMBER ON
WHICH THIS LOGIN IS OCCURING. IT ALSO PUTS IN THAT ENTRY A POINTER
TO AN AUXILLIARY LIST TO CONTAIN OTHER INFORMATION PERTINANT TO
THIS PARTICULAR LOGIN. THE TOTAL INFORMATION STORED BY THE
SUPERVISOR AT THIS TIME IS THE NODE NUMBER, BUFFER NUMBER IN THE NODE,
TERMINAL IDENTIFYING CHARACTER, AND TIMEOUT ITEM NUMBER.
   FRED NOW TYPES HIS USER NAME. AS HE TYPES, EACH CHARACTER IS
SENT TO THE SUPERVISOR IN TYPE 1 RECORDS. IF HE TYPES A
CONTROL H WHEN HIS ECHO IS ON (DURING EITHER USER NAME OR PROJECT
CODE) THE REMOTE CONSIDERS HIM TO BE HALF DUPLEX. WHEN HE
TYPES A SEMICOLON, HIS ECHO IS TURNED OFF. WHEN HE TYPES A CARRIAGE
RETURN, HIS ECHO IS TURNED OFF AND HE DROPS OUT OF LOGIN MODE.
THAT IS, CHARACTERS STOP GOING IN TO THE SUPERVISOR. IF HE
SHOULD TYPE A CARRIAGE RETURN AFTER HIS USER NAME INSTEAD OF
A SEMICOLON, THE SUPERVISOR WILL TELL THE REMOTE TO SEND THE
"PASSWORD" MESSAGE AND PUT FRED BACK INTO LOGIN MODE WITH HIS
ECHO OFF. AFTER FRED HAS TYPED IN ALL THE CHARACTERS
NEEDED FOR A LOGIN, ANY OTHER CHARACTERS HE TYPES WILL BE
HELD IN THE REMOTE'S INPUT BUFFER UNTIL A CIRCUIT IS BUILT.
THE LOGGER ROUTINE IN THE SUPERVISOR HASHES THE USER NAME TO FIND
THE VIRTUAL MUD FILE ADDRESS AND MAKES A REQUEST FOR THAT DATA BLOCK.
WHEN THAT DATA BLOCK HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE DISK, THE
CIPHER OF THE PASSWORD IS CHECKED AND, IF FRED HAS NOT SPECIFIED A
HOST MACHINE NUMBER, HIS NORMAL HOST NUMBER IS FOUND. THE
AFTER CHECKING TO FIND IF THAT HOST IS UP AND FINDING WHICH
BASE SERVICES THAT HOST, THE CIRCUIT BUILDER GOES THROUGH THE
NODE DESCRIPTORS TO FIND A PATH FOR THAT CIRCUIT, ADDING
APPROPRIATE PERMUTER CHANGING COMMANDS TO THE LCOM LIST AS IT
DOES SO. IT DOES NOT ISSUE A COMMAND TO CHANGE THE ENTRY IN THE
REMOTE YET. WHEN ALL THE RESPONSES HAVE BEEN RECIEVED FOR THE PERMUTER
TABLE CHANGES, IT SENDS THE COMMAND TO CHANGE THE PERMUTER TABLE
IN THE REMOTE. WHEN THE RESPONSE FOR THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN
RECIEVED, THE LOGGER SENDS A COMMAND TO THE BASE TO START A NEW
JOB FOR THE APPROPRIATE PORT. BEFORE SENDING THE COMMAND TO CHANGE
THE PERMUTER TABLE IN THE REMOTE, THE LOGGER HAS PLACED INTO THE
BUFFER WHICH INPUTS INTO THE 940 ON THAT PORT THE TERMINAL IDENTIFYING
CHARACTER FOLLOWED BY 2 CHARACTERS SPECIFYING THE NODE AND PORT
OF THE REMOTE FOLLOWED BY THE USER NAME. THESE CHARACTERS ARE THEREFORE
GUARRENTEED TO GET INTO THE 940 BEFORE ANY OTHER CHARACTERS FROM
THE USERS TERMINAL. THE EXEC READS THESE CHARACTERS, INITIALIZES
THE TERMINAL CHARACTERISTICS INTERNAL TO THE 940, STORES THE
NODE AND PORT NUMBER FOR ACCOUNTING, AND HASHES THE USER NAME TO
FIND ITS VIRTUAL LUD ADDRESS. THIS COMPLETES THE LOGIN AS FAR AS
THE SUPERVISOR IS CONCERNED.

*CIRCUIT ZAPPER EFFECTS

   THE CIRCUIT ZAPPER IS ONE OF THE SPECIAL CONTROL CHARACTERS(3)
WITH SPECIAL MEANING TO TYMNET MACHINARY. ITS EFFECT IS TO CLEAR
ALL THE BUFFERS ALONG A CIRCUIT AND SET ALL PERMUTER TABLE ENTRIES
TO -1 (THE NULL ENTRY). IT COMPLETELY DESTROYS THE CIRCUIT. ITS ACTION
IS INDEPENDENT OF THE SUPERVISOR IN ALL CASES AND THEREFORE DOES
NOT NEED THE SUPERVISOR TO DO ITS JOB. IT IS RELEASED BY A REMOTE
WHEN THE USER HANGS UP HIS PHONE. IT IS RELEASED BY A HOST WHEN
AN AUXILLIARY CIRCIUT IS CANCELED, OR ON A NORMAL CIRCUIT
WHEN A USER LOGS OUT OR WHEN AN OPERATOR HANGS SOMEONE.
IT IS RELEASED BY A BASE WHEN A HOST GOES DOWN. IT IS RELEASED
BY ANY NODE WHEN A 201 LINE GOES OUT.
   EXCEPT FOR THE CASES OF A LINE GOING OUT OR A HOST GOING DOWN,
THE SUPERVISOR WILL BE SPECIFICLY INFORMED OF THE RELEASE OF A
CIRCUIT ZAPPER. WHEN A ZAPPER REACHES A HOST ON A NORMAL CIRCUIT,
THAT JOB IS LOGGED OUT. THAT PORT WILL NOT BE USED AGAIN UNTIL THE
HOST OUTPUTS A ZAPPER ON THAT PORT. THUS THE SUPERVISOR MUST REMEMBER
THAT THE PORT IS "IN USE" EVEN THOUGH NO CIRCUIT IS ATTACHED TO IT
   WHEN A ZAPPER REACHES A REMOTE, THE PLEASE LOG IN MESSAGE IS SENT,
THE TERMINAL IDENTIFYING CHARACTER IS SENT TO THE SUPERVISOR, AND
THE TERMINAL IS PLACED IN LOGIN MODE. IF THE USER SHOULD HANG UP
AT THIS TIME, THE "CIRCUIT ZAPPER" WILL BE SENT TO THE SUPERVISOR.
TO ENABLE THE LOGGER TO DISTINGUISH A CIRCUIT ZAPPER (3) FROM A
CONTROL C, ALL ASCII CHARACTERS WILL HAVE A 200 MERGED INTO THEM.
THUS, ASCII CHARACTERS WILL HAVE A NUMERICAL RANGE OF 200-377.
THE SUPERVISOR DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A NEW LOGIN STARTING
THIS WAY AND A LOGIN INITIATED BY A PERSON CALLING IN.
   NOTE THAT ONE IMPLICATION OF THE ABOVE IS THAT WE WILL NOT INITIALLY
TRY TO REROUT CIRCUITS WHEN A 201 LINE GOES OUT. WHEN A LINE GOES
OUT, THE USER DROPS BACK TO LOGGIN MODE AND LOGS IN AGAIN. THIS
IS MUCH SIMPLER THAN TRYING TO SALVAGE A DAMAGED CIRCUIT.

                               -------------------------------------

           1) PLACE THE SELECTOR CHANNEL IN STEP AND CLEAR ALL
              REGISTERS.
           2) AT THE SELECTOR CHANNEL, PLACE THE DISC LOCATION (OCTAL)
              CONTAINING THE BASE CODE IN THE 'A' REGISTER.
           3) PLACE AN OCTAL 017614 IN THE 'P' REGISTER.
           4) PLACE AN OCTAL 054000 IN THE 'U' REGISTER.
           5) PRESS STEP
           6) RESET ALL REGISTERS
           7) PLACE AN OCTAL 017600 IN THE 'P' REGISTER
           8) THE SELECTOR CHANNEL IS NOW READY TO PLACE THE BASE CODE
              FROM THE 940 CORE TO THE BASE, BUT BEFROE DOING THIS,
              THE BASE MUST BE READY. DO THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO READY
              THE BASE:

              A. RESET ALL REGISTERS ON THE BASE.
              B. PLACE THE STARTING LOCATION OF THE BASE BOOTSTRAP IN
                 THE 'P' REGISTER. NOW THE BASE CAN BE LOADED WHEN THE
                 SELECTOR CHANNEL IS STARTED. (LOCATION 17733)

           9)PRESS SYSTEM RESET TWICE ON THE SELECTOR CHANNEL.
           10) PRESS RUN SWITCH TWICE ON THE SELECTOR CHANNEL.
           11) SELECTOR CHANNEL SHOULD NOW BE RUNNING
           12) AT THE BASE, PRESS SYSTEM RESET TWICE.

LAST UPDATE: 9/19/75

                PROBE IS THE ACCESS AND CONTROL PROGRAM
                FOR THE 7/32 SUPERVISOR

   TOPIC HEADINGS START WITH ** LEFT ADJUSTED. IN EDITOR THE
COMMAND SEQUENCE 
*FIND !**!
PRINT? Y
          WILL TYPE OUT A TABLE OF CONTENTS

** STARTUP
   THE FIRST PERSON TO LOGIN TO PROBE AFTER THE 7/32 HAS BEEN BROUGHT
UP WILL BE ASKED TO SUPPLY GREENWICH MEAN TIME IN THE FORMAT
DD:HH:MM WHERE DD IS THE NUMBER OF DAYS SINCE THE BEGINING OF THE
YEAR. WHEN THE TYMNET CLOCK IS INSTALLED, THIS FUNCTION WILL NORMALLY
BE HANDLED BY THE TYMNET CLOCK.

** LOGIN
   ALL INTERDATA SUPERVISORS WILL RUN ON "HOST" SYSTEMS 120 THROUGH
127. THE FOLLOWING ARE VALID WAYS OF GETTING INTO PROBE:
PROBE:127;(PASSWORD);
PROBE:*;(PASSWORD)CR
   THE ASTERISK REFERS TO THE CURRENTLY ACTIVE SUPERVISOR. NOTE THAT
ONE MAY END THE PROBE PASSWORD WITH A SEMICOLON OR CARRIAGE RETURN, BUT
NOT BOTH.
AFTER THE CIRCUIT HAS BEEN BUILT TO THE 7/32, PROBE WILL ASK FOR
THE USER NAME. AFTER THE NAME HAS BEEN ENTERED, IT WILL ASK FOR
THE PASSWORD.

** COMMAND MODE
   WHENEVER A COLON APPEARS ON THE LEFT HAND MARGIN, PROBE IS
READY TO ACCEPT ANOTHER COMMAND. ALL COMMANDS ARE TYPED ON ONE LINE
AND ENDED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN. TO GET BACK TO COMMAND MODE (AFTER
LOGIN HAS BEEN COMPLETED) TYPE A CONTROL Q. THIS WILL ABORT THE
CURRENT ACTIVITY AND RETURN TO COMMAND MODE.

** SYS                  NO STATUS
   TYPE OUT HOST, OR SYSTEM NUMBER.

** TIME                 NO STATUS
   TYPE OUT TIME.

** WHO                  NO STATUS
   THE WHO COMMAND LISTS THE CURRENT PROBE USERS AND THEIR JOB LABLES.
THE LABLES ARE NEEDED FOR THE SEND AND HANG COMMANDS.

** STAT                 NO STATUS
   THIS PRINTS OUT THE VERSION NUMBER OF THE SUPERVISOR, THE NUMBERS
OF NODES IN EACH OF THE 5 TAKEOVER STATES, THE DF, 
AND THE REJECT COUNT. THE REJECT COUNT IS THE COUNT OF THE NUMBER
OF TIMES THE SUPERVISOR COULD NOT BUILD A CIRCUIT BECAUSE OF SHUT 
LINES, LINES OUT OF CHANNELS, OR NODES OUT OF PASSTHROUGHS.

** COUNT                NO STATUS
   THIS COUNTS THE NUMBER OF NODES, TERMINATIONS, AND PASSTHROUGHS
DOES NOT COUNT INTERNAL CIRCUITS AS TERMINATIONS.

** CT NODE              NO STATUS
   THIS TRACES ALL CIRCUITS TERMINATING AT THIS NODE.
PORT NUMBERS ARE IN DECIMAL.

** CP NODE              NO STATUS
   THIS TRACES ALL CIRCUITS PASSING THROUGH THIS NODE.

** CL NODE LINE         NO STATUS
   TRACES CIRCUITS ON THIS LINE.

** HOST
   TYPES INFORMATION ABOUT A HOST OR HOSTS. EXAMPLES:
HOST 19         TYPES INFO ABOUT HOST 19
HOST            TYPES INFO ABOUT ALL HOSTS
   THE INFO TYPED IS HOST NUMBER, DOWN, SHUT OR ANSWERED,
POSITION NUMBER ON ITS BASE, AND BASE NUMBER

** AN                   NO STATUS
   ALL NODES. FOR ALL NODES IN NET TYPE OUT NODE NUMBER, VERSION NUMBER,
HOST NUMBERS (IF ANY), TERMINATIONS (NOT COUNTING INTERNAL CIRCUITS),
PASSTHROUGHS, CRASH COUNT, UPSTREAM NODE NUMBER, AND DOWNSTREAM
NODE NUMBER.

**  EXC                 NO STATUS
   LIST LINES WHICH ARE OUT OR IN SOME OTHER EXCEPTIONAL STATE.

** N
   SHORT FOR NODE, SEE BELOW.

** NODE NODE            NO STATUS
   EXAMPLE:
NODE 5
WILL GIVE VERSION NUMBER, CRASH COUNT, UPSTREAM DIRECTION, DOWNSTREAM
DIRECTION, AND EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS FOR THIS NODE. WILL ALSO GIVE
NUMBER OF PASSTHROUGHS AND TERMINATIONS. IF NODE IS A BASE,
WILL GIVE HOST NUMBERS AND STATUS OF EACH HOST. WILL ALSO GIVE 
NEIGHBOR NUMBER, NUMBER OF GROUPS, COST OF USING LINE, AND EXCEPTIONAL
CONDITIONS FOR EACH LINE. DOES NOT COUNT INTERNAL CIRCUITS
AS TERMINATIONS.

** DF (NUMBER)          STATUS 01
   DROWSYNESS FACTOR. WHEN THE SUPERVISOR GOES TO SLEEP, IT COMPUTES THE
NUMBER OF SECONDS IT IS TO REMAIN ASLEEP BASED ON ITS NUMBER, ECT. THE
DROWSYNESS FACTOR IS A NUMBER THAT GETS ADDED IN. 1000 DECIMAL IS THE
LARGEST NUMBER THAT ONE MAY ENTER. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF
SUPPRESSING THE SUPERVISOR.

** AWAKE                STATUS 01
   AWAKEN SUPERVISOR RIGHT AWAY. OVERRIDES ALL PREVIOUS REASONS FOR
SLEEPING, INCLUDING A LARGE DF.

IMMEADIATELY. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT COPIED TO OTHER SYSTEMS. IF AN
ASSEMBLED IN USER NAME HAS ITS PASSWORD CHANGED, USER SHOULD
TELL LA ROY TYMES SO HE CAN PUT THE NEW CIPHER INTO THE SYMBOLICS.

** LIST                 RESTRICTED STATUS
   LIST OUT THE USER NAMES ON THE DISK,TOGETHER WITH THEIR
SLOT NUMBERS AND STATUS BITS.

** ENTER S NAME S       RESTRICTED STATUS
   SOME USER NAMES ARE ASSEMBLED INTO PROBE. THESE USERS HAVE
STATUS TO EXECUTE ALL COMMANDS. THERE ARE 64 SLOTS ON THE DISK FOR OTHER
USER NAMES. THE LIST COMMAND WILL DISPLAY THEM. THE ENTER COMMAND WILL
MAKE CHANGES TO THE LIST. EXAMPLES:
ENTER 49                REMOVE ENTRY 49
ENTER 0 SAM 77          ENTER SAM INTO SLOT 0. TURN ON ALL STATUS BITS
        SO HE CAN EXECUTE ALL COMMANDS EXCEPT LIST, ENTER, AND INITL.
ENTER 63 JANJANJI 00    PUT JANJANJI INTO SLOT 63 WITH NO STATUS. HE CAN
        STILL EXECUTE COMMANDS WHICH REQUIRE NO STATUS.
ENTER 5 MACK 20         PUT MACK INTO SLOT 5 WITH STATUS 20. HE CAN
        EXECUTE RETAKE, WHICH REQUIRES STATUS 20, BUT NOT ESHUT, WHICH 
        REQUIRES STATUS 10. TO EXECUTE BOTH, HE WOULD REQUIRE
        10+20=30.
ENTER 4 SHERRY 30       SHERRY CAN EXECUTE ALL STATUS 20 AND STATUS 10
        COMMANDS.

   SLOT NUMBERS ARE DECIMAL FROM 0 TO 63. STATUS NUMBERS ARE OCTAL,
6 BITS LONG, ONE BIT FOR EACH STATUS CLASS. A NAME CAN BE FROM 1 TO 8
CHARACTERS LONG AND CAN INCLUDE LETTERS, NUMBERS, AND A FEW OTHER 
CHARACTERS.

** INITL                RESTRICTED STATUS  CAN ONLY BE EXECUTED
                                FROM SPROBE
   INITIALIZES THE ERROR LOG TO ALL ZEROES. SHOULD ONLY BE DONE AFTER
DISK MAINTAINENCE, AS DOING IT ANY OTHER TIME WOULD DESTROY THE ERROR
LOG.

   INSTALLING DISK PACKS

   THE DISK PACK IS STORED IN A CLEAR PLASTIC , DUSTPROOF CASE COMPRISING
   A TOP COVER AND HANDLE, AND A BOTTOM COVER. TO INSTALL THE DISK PACK
   PROCEDURES AS FOLLOWS:

              A. OPEN DISK PACK DRAWER
              B. REMOVE THE BOTTOM COVER FROM DISK PACK
              C. CAREFULLY LOWER DISK PACK ONTO DISK DRIVE SPINDLE.
              D. ROTATE TOP COVER HANDLE CLOCKWISE TO LOCK DISK PACK ON
                 SPINDLE AND DISENGAGE COVER; LIFT AND REMOVE COVER.
              E. PLACE TOP AND BOTTOM COVERS TOGETHER TO PREVENT DUST
                 ACCUMULATION IN THE CASE.
              F. CLOSE DRAWER.

   REMOVING DISK PACK

   NOTE: DO NOT OPEN DISK PACK ACCESS DRAWER UNTIL DISK PACK HAS STOPPED
         ROTATING.

              A. SET ON/OFF SWITCH TO OFF POSITION. DISK PACK WILL STOP
                 ROTATING IN APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS.
              B. OPEN DISK PACK ACCESS DRAWER.
              C. CAREFULLY PLACE TOP COVER OVER DISK PACK.
              D. ROTATE TOP COVER HANDLE COUNTERCLOCKWISE TO ENGAGE
                 LOCKING MECHANISM OF DISK PACK TO TOP COVER.
              E. WHEN LOCKING MECHANISM IS SECURE (MECHANISM "CLICKS" AS
                 COVER IS ROTATED), CAREFULLY REMOVE DISK PACK FROM DRIVE
                 SPINDLE.
              F. PLACE BOTTOM COVER UNDER DISK PACK AND TURN RETAINING
                 KNOB CLOCKWISE UNTIL SECURE.
              G. CLOSE DRAWER.


   DISK DRIVE OPERATION

   READYING DISK DRIVE FOR ON-LINE OPERATION

              A. INSTALL DISK PACK ON DRIVE SPINDLE AND CLOSE DRAWER.
              B. SET ON/OFF TOGGLE SWITCH TO ON. DISK DRIVE PERFORMS
                 INITIAL LOAD SEQUENCE.
              C. OBSERVE THAT THE GREEN "READY" INDICATOR LIGHTS.

   THE DISK DRIVE IS NOW FULLY UNDER CONTROL OF THE CONTROLLER. NO
   OPERATOR INTERVENTION IS REQUIRED UNLESS:

              A. A DISK PACK CHANGE IS REQUIRED
              B. THE SELECT LOCK INDICATOR TURNS ON, INDICATING THAT
                 A MALFUNCTION HAS OCCURRED.

   TO CLEAR A SELECT LOCK INDICATION, SET ON/OFF TOGGLE SWITCH TO OFF.
   THE DISK PACK STOPS ROTATING AND THE RED SELECT LOCK INDICATOR TURNS 
   OFF. IF THE SELECT LOCK REOCCURS AFTER RESTARTING
   THE DRIVE, MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED.

   TAKING DISK DRIVE OFF-LINE

              A. SET ON/OFF TOGGLE SWITCH TO OFF.

   NOTE: DO NOT OPEN DISK PACK ACCESS DRAWER UNTIL DISK PACK HAS STOPPED
        ROTATING.
              B. DISK DRIVE IS NOW OFF LINE AND POWERED DOWN.

 IV. GENERAL INFORMATION

       A. DISK PACKS

           1. NEVER MOUNT A DISK PACK ON A FILE DRIVE IF THE
              PACK HAS BEEN DROPPED OR SHOWS SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE.
              SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE FILE DRIVE CAN RESULT. CALL THE
              CUSTOMER ENGINEER RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SERVICE IF PACK
              DAMAGE IS SUSPECTED.

           2. ALWAYS BE SURE THAT TOP AND BOTTOM COVERS ARE TOGETHER
              (EVEN WHEN NOT CONTAINING THE DISK PACK.)

           3. ALWAYS STORE DISK PACKS FLAT, NOT ON EDGE.

           4. EACH PACK SHOULD REST ON A SHELF, NOT ON ANOTHER DISK
              PACK.


           5. STORE DISK PACKS IN A MACHINE ROOM ATMOSPHERE.
              (60 TO 90 F, 16 TO 32 C, 10 TO 80% HUMIDITY.)

           6. IF A DISK PACK MUST BE STORED IN A DIFFERENT ENVIROMENT,
              ALLOW TWO HOURS FOR ADJUSTMENT TO MACHINE ROOM ATMOSPHERE
              BEFORE USE.


       B. DISK PACK LABELING

           1. NEVER PUT LABELS ANYWHERE ON A DISK PACK EXCEPT INSIDE
              THE CENTER HUB. USE ONLY AN APPROVED DISK PACK LABEL
              (IBM P/N 2267763 OR EQUIVALENT).

           2. NEVER PUT LABELS ON THE SIDE OF THE DISK PACK TOP COVER.
              LABELS CAN COME OFF AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE FILE DRIVE.

           3. DO NOT USE A LEAD PENCIL OR ANY WRITING IMPLEMENT
              WHICH MAY PRODUCE A LOOSE RESIDUE. NEVER ERASE A LABEL
              ON THE PACK (THE OLD LABEL SHOULD BE REMOVED AND A NEW
              ONE APPLIED).

           4. NEVER PLACE LOOSE LABELS OR CARDS INSIDE THE PACK
              COVERS WHEN REMOVING THE PACK FROM THE DRIVE. 


       C. STOPPAGES

      IF PROBLEMS ARE ENCOUNTERED IN PROGRAMMED OPERATION OF THE DISK
      DRIVE, THE FOLLOWING CHECK LIST SHOULD BE USED:

           1. MODULE I.D. PLUGS (CORRECT I.D. PLUG SHOULD BE FULLY
              INSERTED IN THE RECEPTACLE OF EACH MODULE).

           2. THE DISK PACK (SHOULD BE MOUNTED AND THE MODULE DRAWER
              SECURELY LATCHED CLOSED).

           3. START STOP SWITCH (SHOULD BE ON AND AS A RESULT THE FILE
              SHOULD BE IN A READY CONDITION, GREEN LIGHT ON.)



      D. SELECT LOCKS (RED INDICATORS ON)

           IMPORTANT: SELECT LOCK INDICATIONS MAY BE RESET BY POWERING
           OFF THE DISK DRIVE AND THEN TURNING IT BACK ON. IF THE SELECT
           LOCK PERSISTS, THE DRIVE SHOULD BE SPARED AND NORMAL TROUBLE
           REPORTING PROCEDURES FOLLOWED:

      DISK I/O ERRORS

           1. VERIFY THE DISK PACK IS PROPERLY INITIALIZED AND HAS CORRECT
              VTOC.

           2. WHEN PERMANENT READ ERRORS OCCURVIDHE PACK SHOULD BE MOVED
              TO ANOTHER MODULE. DO NOT MOUNT ANOTHER PACK ON THE
              FAILING MODULE.

           3. NEVER MOVE A DISK PACK CAUSING ERRORS MORE THAN ONCE.
              CALL A CUSTOMER ENGINEER AND HAVE BOTH THE FILE DRIVES
              AND THE DISK PACK INSPECTED FOR DAMAGE IF ERRORS PERSIST.
              IF NO PERMANENT READ ERRORS ARE PRESENT WHEN THE PROGRAM
              IS RETIRED, THE MODULE THAT FAILED SHOULD BE SPARED AND
              NORMAL TROUBLE REPORTING PROCEDURES FOLLOWED.






                               THE PACKCOPY PROGRAM
                               --------------------

      PURPOSE: TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF COPYING DISK PACKS.

      CAPABILITIES:

           READS PACKS 0/1, 2/3 AND 4/5 AND COPIES TO PACK OF ANOTHER
           SET IN THE POSITION OF PACK 6/7. READS PACK 6/7 OF THE ORIGINAL
           SET AND COPIES TO A PACK IN THE POSITION OF PACK 4/5.

           PACK IDENTIFICATION RECORDS ARE CHECKED TO PREVENT WRITING
           ON PACKS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM, OR PACKS OF THE SAME SET. APPROX-
           IMATELY TWENTY MINUTES IS REQUIRED TO COPY A PACK. ALTMODES ARE
           INHIBITED AND EXIT FROM THE PROGRAM MUST BE ILLUSTRATED BELOW.


      OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:

      A. IF COPYING PACKS 0/1, 2/3, 4/5 PLACE THE PACK TO BE 
         WRITTEN TO IN THE POSITION OF PACK 6/7. IF COPYING PACK 6/7
         PLACE THE PACK TO BE WRITTEN TO IN THE POSITION OF PACK 4/5.

      (AT THIS POINT THE OPERATOR SHOULD REMOVE THE PACK FROM DRIVE 6/7
       AND REPLACE IT WITH THE NEXT PACK TO BE WRITTEN TO. THEN HE 
       SHOULD TYPE THE NUMBER OF THE PACK TO BE READ, TERMINATED BY
       A CARRIAGE RETURN.)

           WRITE ON PACK? 6 CR

      (THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL ALL PACKS ARE
       COPIED. THE OPERATOR SHOULD THEN TYPE A Q IN REPLY TO THE
       QUESTION "READ FROM PACK?", AND THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE.
       DO THIS ONLY IF ALL PACKS FROM A PARTICULAR SET ARE IN READY.)

      IF AN OPERATOR ATTEMPTS TO COPY THE SAME PACK TWICE DURING A 
      SINGLE CALL TO THIS PROGRAM THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WILL BE TYPED:

           THIS IS THE SECOND READ FROM PACK (N)
           CARRIAGE RETURN TO CONTINUE.

      IF THE OPERATOR INDEED WANTS TO MAKE A SECOND COPY OF A PACK
      HE SHOULD TYPE A CARRIAGE RETURN, ELSE HE SHOULD TYPE ANY OTHER
      CHARACTER AND THE PROGRAM WILL RESPOND WITH:

           READ FROM PACK

      AND HE MAY THEN ENTER THE CORRECT PACK NO.

      IF THE OPERATOR IS READING PACK 0/1, 2/3 OR 4/5 AND ENTERS
      ANY NUMBER BUT 6 WHEN ASKED "WRITE ON PACK"
      THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WILL BE TYPED:

           IF YOU ARE READING FROM PACK (N), YOU MUST WRITE ON PACK 6

      OR, IF HE IS READING FROM A PACK LOCATED ON DRIVE 6/7 AND ENTERS
      ANYTHING BUT 4 THE PROGRAM WILL TYPE:

           IF YOU ARE READING FROM PACK 6 YOU MUST WRITE ON PACK 4

      THE MESSAGE "WRITE ON PACK?" WILL FOLLOW ALLOWING HIM TO ENTER
      THE CORRECT PACK NO.

      IN CASE OF UNRECOVERABLE READ OR WRITE ERRORS THE ADDRESS OF
      ERRORS WILL BE REPORTED AS FOLLOWS:

           DISC ERRORS, OCTAL
           DP ADRS PACK CYL HEAD REC

           DP ADRS= DISC ADDRESS
           PACK= PACK NO.
           CYL= CYLINDER NO.
           HEAD= HEAD NO.
           REC = RECORD NO.

      THIS RECORD SHOULD BE TURNED OVER TO THE OPERATOR'S SUPERVISOR.


      OTHER ERROR MESSAGES WHICH MAY BE ENCOUNTERED ARE:

                               SINGLE HOST DIM ROUTINES
                               ------------------------

    THE FOLOWING ROUTINES MAY NOW BE USED IN DIM DURING NON-TIME
SHARING HOURS.

    1. N,UP@
              BRINGS UP THE 940. N=SYSTEM NUMBER (USUALLY 2)
    2. FORMAT@
              FORMATS DISC PACK NUMBER 7. ANY ERRORS ENCOUNTERED WILL BE
              TYPED ON THE 620 TTY AND THE ROUTINE WILL CONTINUE.
    3. ERRORS@
              TYPES ANY DISC ERRORS THAT HAVE OCURRED WHILE THIS PARTICULAR
              DIM HAS BEEN RUNNING. TYPING 2,UP@ WILL BRING IN A NEW 620
              DIM AND DESTROY THIS INFORMATION.
    4. NUR@ AND NUW@
              THESE TWO ROUTINES READ (NUR@) OR WRITE THEN READ (NUW@)
              KNOWN DATA ON TEST PACK 3. THE DATA READ IS CHECKED AGAINST
              THE KNOWN PATTERN. ANY DATA COMPARE ERRORS OR I/O ERRORS
              ARE TYPED OUT AS THEY OCCUR. AT THE BEGINNING A
              SHORT SEEK TEST IS MADE TO EVERY CYLINDER AND HEAD NUMBER AND
              THE MESSAGE 'SEEK PASS COMPLETE' IS TYPED WHEN DONE. A SHORT
              (15 MIN) COMMAND CHAIN PASS IS THEN MADE, FOLLOWED BY A DATA
              CHAIN PASS (15 MIN). AFTER THIS MORE THOROUGH TESTS ARE MADE
              THESE TESTS WILL RUN FOR HOURS.
    5. TSTPK@
              THIS ROUTINE WRITES THE TEST PATTERN ON PACK #3.
              TIME: 40 MINUTES
              IF YOU HAVE A MASTER TEST PACK YOU MAY USE THE REGULAR TIME
              SHARING PACKCOPY ROUTINE TO MAKE A TEST PACK. THIS TAKES ABOUT
              5 MIN. (SEE PACKCOPY DOC.)

    NOTE: PUTTING SENSE SWITCH 1 UP WILL STOP ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WHILE THEY
              THEY ARE RUNNING. STOPPING THEM ANY OTHER WAY MAY CAUSE 
              ERRONEOUS DISC ERRORS.

              THE TEST PACK (#3) SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH NUR@ OR NUW@.
              USING IT WITH THE 'S' PLUG IN CE MODE WILL RUIN THE FORMAT.
              IF THIS HAPPENS THE PACK MUST BE FORMMATTED BEFORE BEING
              USED AGAIN. FORMATTING A PACK WRITES ZEROES IN ALL DATA FIELDS.
              THE 620  CRASH LOCATION IS AT OCTAL 77. IF THE 620 GOES INTO STEP
              AT ANY OTHER LOCATION, DO THE FOLLOWING:
              1. TAKE THE 940 DOWN.
              2. PUT SENSE SWITCH 3 UP ON THE 620 AND START THE 620 AT
                 LOCATION 0.
              THIS WILL GIVE YOU A DIM CRASH WHEN YOU BRING THE 940 UP AGAIN.
































                               DUAL HOST DIM ROUTINES
                               ----------------------
       DESCRIPTION OF THE DUAL SELECTOR CHANNEL DIM VERSION 11

PLEASE SEND CRITICISM OF THIS DOCUMENT TO DAVID GARDNER OR TO
DAVE ON C2. DIM LISTINGS ARE NOT PROPRIETARY. ANYBODY CAN MAKE A LISTING.
SEND MAIL TO DAVE ON C2 TO FIND OUT HOW TO LIST IT.

A KNOWLEDGE OF THE SINGLE HOST DISC MONITOR (DIM) IS ASSUMED.
DIM FACTS FOLLOW.

PRACTICALLY ALL THE DIM CODE IS NEW.

DIM NOW CONTROLS 2 HOSTS FROM UP TO 16 LOGICAL 2314 DISC PACKS, WHERE
ONE 940 CAN ADDRESS PACKS 0-7 AND THE OTHER HOST CAN ADDRESS PACKS
8-15 (8-F THE CALCOMP ADDRESSING PLUGS ARE IN HEXADECIMAL)

THE NEW DIM CAN PERFORM UP TO 8 CONCURRENT SEEKS. THIS WILL ALLEVIATE
THE PROBLEM OF SHARING THE DISC RESOURCES BETWEEN TWO HOSTS AND WILL
OCCASIONALLY HELP A SINGLE HOST TO ACHEIVE FASTER RESPONSE ON SOME
BURSTS OF DISC REQUESTS.  UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT SWAPPING BOTTLE NECK
AND THE SCHEDULING ALGORIRITHMS CONSISTENT WITH THE TINY 940 MEMORY,
PREVENTS THE 940 FROM MAKING A LOT OF CONCURRENT DISC REQUESTS ON 
DIFFERENT PACKS.


THE CHANNEL CAN ONLY SERVE ONE HOST AT A TIME SO SOMETIMES ONE HOST MAY
HAVE TO WAIT A SHORT TIME TO GET THE CHANNEL. THE CHANNEL IS DEDICATED
TO ONE 940 DURING A TRANSFER AND THE ROTATIONAL LATENCY TIME THAT
PRECEDES ALL TRANSFERS. DIM DOES NOT TRY TO OPTIMIZE LATENCLY DELAYS.
INTERFERENCE OF THIS SORT WILL CAUSE A VERY LOW AVERAGE DELAY SINCE THE
CHANNEL IS TIED UP ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TIME.

THE NEW DIM WILL PROBABLY HAVE AN OVERALL SLIGHTLY FASTER RESPONSE TIME.

DIM WILL SAVE CRASHES IN THE OLD WAY EXCEPT THAT IT WILL ALSO PUT SOME
CRASH INFORMATION ON DISC 24 FROM MEMORY LOCATIONS 140000 TO 177777.
DIM WILL NEVER AUTOMATICALLY RELOAD ITSELF.
THE OPERATOR WILL BE ABLE TO RELOAD THE DIM MEMORY
BY BRANCHING TO THE 17600 IPL. DIM RELOADS ARE RECOMMENDED AFTER ALL
DIM CRASHES SINCE THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY DESTROYED 
INFORMATION IN A VITAL PART OF MEMORY. DIM IS CODED TO RESTART FROM
LOCATION 0 OF MEMORY. THIS IS A HANDY BUT DANGEROUS FEATURE TO BE USED
WITH DISCRETION.


IF SENSE SWITCH 1 IS ON WHEN THE OPERATOR BRANCHES TO THE 17600 IPL LOADER,
AN ALTERNATE COPY OF DIM WILL BE LOADED INTO THE 620 MEMORY.
SENSE SWITCH 2 HAS NO USE.
SENSE SWITCH 3 WILL CRASH A RUNNING DIM.

DIM DDT HAS AN IMPROVED COMMAND SET, A COMPRESSED SYMBOL TABLE, AND A
LESS ANNOYING STATUS SCHEME. SEE BELOW FOR THE DDT COMMAND SET AND THE
DESCRIPTION OF DIAGNOSTIC AND UTILITY PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE CALLED FROM
DIM.

ALTHOUGH DIM IS SHORT ON MEMORY SPACE, ALL THE DIM FEATURES FIT IN ONE
8K VERSION WITH NO ASSEMBLY SWITCHES.

P=77 AFTER A DIM CRASH. A AND LOCATION 77 CONTAIN THE MARK LOCATION OF
CRASHV. CRASHV IS THE VARIAN CRASH SUBROUTINE. CRASHH IS THE HOST CRASH
SUBROUTINE WHICH IS NOT FATAL TO THE 620. LOCATION 100 CONTAINS A
POINTER TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CRASHV CODE.


*              *****************************************************

A DIM DDT REFERENCE FOLLOWS.

CONTROL S TERMINATES AND ABORTS DDT TTY INPUT AND OUTPUT.
CONTROL S ALSO TERMINATES MOST OF THE LONG RUNNING OPERATOR CODES.


;[ OR ;$ OR ;] OR ;" WILL SET THE STANDARD DDT TYPE OUT MODE TO BE
OCTAL, SIGNED INTEGER, SYMBOLIC, OR ASC.

LET EXP BE ANY VALID DDT EXPRESSION.
EXP[ AND EXP$ AND EXP] AND EXP" TYPE OUT THE CONTENTS OF THE CELL
AT LOCATION EXP AND OPEN THAT CELL.

[ AND $ AND ] AND " WITH NO ARGUMENT EXPRESSION TYPE OUT THE CELL
POINTED TO BY THE LAST EXPRESSION THAT DDT TYPED.


= AND # AND _ AND ' THE TRANSLATE AND TYPE OUT THE LAST STRING
TYPED BY THE USER OR DDT. THE OUTPUT IS OCTAL, SIGNED INTEGER, SYMBOLIC,
OR ASC.

/ ACTS LIKE [ OR $ OR ] OR " DEPENDING ON THE CURRENT TYPE OUT MODE
WHICH IS INITIALLY SYMBOLIC AND CAN BE CHANGED BY THE ;[ OR ;$ OR ;]
OR ;" COMMANDS.

CONTROL B FOLLOWED BY A STRING IS THE BIT LOOKER COMMAND.

LINE FEED OPENS AND TYPES OUT THE CELL AFTER THE LAST CELL THAT WAS
OPENED.

UP ARROW OPENS AND TYPES THE CELL PREVIOUS TO THE LAST CELL THAT WAS
OPENED.

CARRIAGE RETURN CLOSES A CELL.

CARRIAGE RETURN, LINE FEED, OR UP ARROW ALL CHANGE  A CELL IF THEY
ARE PRECEDED BY AN EXPRESSION. IF THE EXPRESSION IS INVALID, DDT TYPES
A QUESTION MARK AND IT IS OK TO TRY AGAIN WITH A NEW EXPRESSION OR TO
FORGET THE EXPRESSION AND JUST CLOSE THE OPEN CELL.

THE AT SIGN COMMAND IS DISCONTINUED. OPERATOR COMMANDS ARE EXECUTED VIA
THE ;G COMMAND.

EXP;A, EXP;B, EXP;X PRESET THE A,B, AND X VALUES FOR THE NEXT ;G
COMMAND.

EXP;G JUMPS TO THE LOCTION EXP WITH THE CURRENT VALUES OF ;A, ;B, AND ;X
IN A,B,X. THE FIRST INTRUCTION AT LOCATION EXP MUST BE A COPY AX OR DDT
WILL NOT ALLOW THE ;G TO TAKE CONTROL UNLESS THE USER HAS SET STATUS.
THE CODE REACHED BY THE ;G COMMAND MAY RETURN TO DDT BY EXECUTING A JMP L
INTRUCTION WHICH WILL SET ;A, ;B, AND ;X TO NEW VALUES OF A,B,X. OR A
JMP RST INTRUCTION WILL RETURN TO DDT WITHOUT CHANGEING 
;A, ;B, AND ;X. IT IS LEGAL TO USE THE ;G COMMAND WITH TWO ARGUMENT
EXPRESSIONS AS IN 6,FORMAT;G WHICH CALLS THE FORMAT CODE WITH
THE ARGUMENT 6.
       NOTE TO DIM CODERS AND PATCHERS. IF THE ;G ROUTINE IS LONG
AND OF LOW PRIORITY IT SHOULD FREQUENTLY CALL THE MAYDMS ROUTINE BY
EXECUTING      ... JMPM; H; +MAYDMS ... 
               .... IN ORDER TO GET TEMPORARILY DISMISSED WHILE
IMPORTANT DIM FUNCTIONS CATCH UP WITH REAL TIME DEMANDS. MAYDMS WILL
RETURN TO THE USER AFTER 50 CYCLES OF EXECUTION TIME IF NO REAL TIME
SYSTEM DEMANDS ARE PENDING. IF THERE ARE SOME REAL TIME JOBS TO BE
PROCESSED, MAYDMS WILL GIVE CONTROL TO DIM TO LET DIM CATCH UP. AFTER A
FEW HUNDRED MICROSECONDS DIM WILL RETURN TO MAYDMS WHICH WILL
RETURN TO THE CALLER AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.
       MAYDMS PRESERVES B AND X BUT DESTROYS A.
       MAYDMS ALSO CHECKS TO SEE IF THE USER TYPED A CONTROL S. IF THE
USER HAS TYPED A CONTROL S, MAYDMS TAKES CONTROL AWAY FROM THE USER
PROGRAM AND RETURNS CONTROL TO DDT.
       DIM MAY BE TIMESHAREING WHILE THE USER CODE IS RUNNING. IF DIM
IS TIMESHAREING, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MAYDMS
AT LEAST EVERY FEW MILISECONDS OR THE SERVICE TO THE 940S WILL BE LESS
THAN FULL SPEED. IF NO 940S ARE UP IT IS GOOD PRACTICE
TO CALL MAYDMS SO THAT CERTAIN TIMEOUT ROUTINES GET TO RUN. IF MAYDMS
IS NOT CALLED, IT WILL NOT HURT DIM ALTHOUGH DIM WILL NOT
RUN OPTIMALLY.

EXP;1, EXP;2, EXP;M, AND EXP;L SET THE WORD SEARCH PARAMETERS.

;Z ALWAYS CHANGES MEMORY BETWEEN ;1 AND ;2 INCLUSIVE. ;Z CHANGES CELLS
TO 0. EXP;Z CHANGES CELLS TO EXP. EXP1,EXP2 SUBSTITUTES EXP1 FOR EVERY 
OCCURANCE OF EXP2 IN THE ;Z RANGE.

;W AND ;# ARE WORD SEARCH COMMANDS. THEY REFER TO ;1, ;2, AND ;M.

EXP;/ TYPES OUT A 940 CELL FROM THE 940 SELECTED BY M540.
0,EXP;/ OR 1,EXP;/ SET M540 TO 0 (LOWER PACKS 940) OR 1 (UPPER PACKS
940) AND AND THEN ACT LIKE EXP;/ .
THE CURRENT 940 TYPE OUT CELL IS M540 WHICH CAN BE SET WITH THE TWO
ARGUMENTS ;/ COMMAND OR ANY OTHER CONVENIENT WAY.

SEMILINEFEED  TYPES OUT THE NEXT 940 CELL.

EXP1,EXP2 SEMILINEFEED TYPES OUT A RANGE OF 940 CELLS FROM THE CURRENTLY
SELECTED 940 WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE CONTENTS OF M540.

EXP1,EXP2%/ ASKS FOR AN OCTAL VALUE AND SETS A RANGE OF 940 CELLS TO
THAT VALUE. IF THE RANGE IS 0 TO 177777 THE COMMAND TAKES 45 SECONDS
TO COMPLETE. THE COMMAND CAN BE ESCAPED WITH A CONTROL S. WHEN THE COMMAND
COMPLETES NORMALLY IT TYPES A CARRIAGE RETURN. THIS COMMAND READS
BACK EVERYTHING IT TRIES TO STORE IN THE 940 AND EXITS WITH A QUESTION
MARK IF IT EVER GETS A BAD READ BACK.

EXP%/ WORKS LIKE EXP1,EXP2%/ EXCEPT IT ONLY CHANGES ONE 940 CELL.

EXP1,EXP2%W ASKS FOR AN OCTAL VALUE AND THEN SEARCHES A RANGE OF 940
CELLS FOR THAT VALUE AND TYPES OUT WHERE THE VALUE WAS FOUND.


OPERATOR COMMANDS FOR UTILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC  PURPOSES ARE DESCRIBED
BELOW.

OPERATOR COMMANDS ARE REACHED VIA THE ;G COMMAND. THE AT SIGN COMMAND IS
DISCONTINUED.

VERS;G  TYPES THE DIM VERSION NUMBER. THE VERSION IS ALSO TYPED WHEN
THE DIM IS STARTED OR RESTARTED. THE OCTAL VERSION NUMBER IS LOCATED
IN THE CELL JUST BEFORE VERS. THE VERSION NUMBER MAY BE PATCHED VIA
THE VERS-1[ COMMAND.

0,STAT;G AND 1,STAT;G RESET OR SET STATUS. DDT ASKS FOR A PASSWORD TO
SET STATUS. STATUS IS REQUIRED FOR DANGEROUS COMMANDS AND DDT
TELLS THE USER WHEN STATUS IS LACKING. ONCE SET, STATUS REMAINS SET
UNTIL A 0,STAT;G COMMAND OR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF NO DDT
COMMANDS ELAPSES.

WP;G  WRITE PROTECTS THE DISC FROM ALL NORMAL DIM WRITES. DIM ONLY
SLIGHTLY MODIFIES THE CHANNEL PROGRAMS SO A WP COMMAND LETS THE CHANNEL
EXERCISE IN A MODE VERY SIMILAR TO THE WRITE ENABLED MODE. THERE ARE A
FEW SPECIAL ROUTINES THAT ARE ALWAYS WRITE ENABLED. THESE EXCEPTIONS
ARE NEVER CALLED AUTOMATICALLY AND THESE EXCEPTIONS ARE INDIVIDUALLY
DETAILED BELOW.

WE;G WRITE ENABLES THE DISC. DIM COMES UP WRITE ENABLED.

UP;G  ASKS THE OPERATOR FOR THE HOST NUMBER AND THE MONITOR LOC.
UP SAVES THE CRASH ON LOC. 0,1,20 AND 24 AND LOADS THE MONITOR
INTO THE 940 MEMORY. WITHOUT STATUS THE LOC. MUST BE LESS
THAN 17. IF THE HOST SPECIFIED IS ON NEITHER THE LOWER OR UPPER
PACKS, DIM TYPES BAD HOST NUMBER. IF EITHER PACK 0 OR PACK 8 IS OFF LINE
AND THE HOST NUMBER IS INVALID, DIM TYPES IO ER. IF AN IO ERROR OCCURS
IN LOADING THE MONITOR, DIM TYPES IO ER. IF THE OPERATOR DOES NOT KNOW
WHAT HOSTS ARE ON HIS PACKS, HE MUST BRING UP A KNOWN HOST AND READ
THE HOST NUMBER OFF THE UNKNOWN PACKS. THE UP COMMAND MAY ALSO
TYPE "ER,ALREADY UP" OR "MIC ER".  UP ONLY CHECKS FOR DISC READ ERRORS.
DISC WRITE ERRORS DO NOT ABORT THE UP COMMAND. IF IO ER KEEPS A 940 FROM
COMING UP, THAT HOST IS DOWN UNTIL AN EXPERT DIAGNOSES THE PROBLEM.
UP-1;G WORKS LIKE UP;G EXCEPT THAT IT INHIBITS THE CRASHSAVE.

TDI;G TYPES DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION. TDI TYPES OUT LOCATION 14, 44-51,
THE LAST CHANNEL PROGRAM EXECUTED AND THE CHANNEL PROGRAM DATA. TDI
ALSO DOES A SENSE AND TYPES OUT 6 SENSE BYTES IF ADVISEABLE. THERE ARE
SOME CHANNEL PROGRAMS THAT TDI CANNOT TYPE OUT, BUT TDI HANDLES MOST OF
THEM. THE TDI TYPE OUT CAN BE ABORTED BY TYPING A CONTROL S.

EXP,PC;G COPIES PACK A STARTING AT CYLINDER B AND HEAD X TO PACK EXP.
IT IS ALWAYS NECESSARY TO CHECK ;A, ;B, AND ;X BEFORE CALLING PC.  THE
USER MAY ABORT PC BY TYPING CONTROL S ON THE DIM TTY. WHEN PC ABORTS
IT LEAVES ;A, ;B, AND ;X AT A GOOD PLACE TO RESTART PC. PC WILL COPY
2 LOGICAL PACKS IF ;A AND EXP ARE EVEN. PC TYPES OK WHEN IT IS DONE.

EXP,RB;G READS A 600 WORD BLOCK FROM PACK EXP, CYLINDER A, HEAD B, AND
RECORD X INTO THE 620 BUFFER CALLED DBF. UNLIKE MOST OPERATOR COMMANDS
RB WILL NOT RUN UNLESS THE USER HAS SET STATUS.

EXP,RT;G READS A TEST PACK THAT HAS BEEN INITIALIZED BY WT (SEE BELOW).
RT EXERCISES THE SELECTOR CHANNEL AND PACK EXP. RT IGNORES ;B
AND ;X, BUT ;A MUST BE PRESET. IF ;A IS ODD, RT DOES SOME OF ITS READS
INTO, 940 MEMORY. IF ;A IS EVEN RT READS ONLY INTO THE 620. IF ;A/2 IS
EVEN RT TYPES OUT DETAILED DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION ABOUT  THE CHANNEL
PROGRAM THAT CAUSED AN ERROR. IF ;A/2 IS ODD, RT TYPE OUT ABREVIATED
DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION. IF ;A/4 IS EVEN, RT CONTINUES TO RUN
INDEFINITELY.  IF ;A/4 IS ODD, RT RETURNS TO DDT AFTER THE FIRST ERROR
TYPE OUT.  THE USER CAN ALWAYS ABORT RT BY TYPING CONTROL S ON THE DIM
TTY.  RT CHECKS FOR SEEK ERRORS, SKIP FAILURES, DATA ERRORS, AND MIC
ERRORS IF THE 940 IS INCLUDED IN THE DIAGNOSES. ALL READ AND SKIP DATA
IS AIMED AT A CELL IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 620 DISC INPUT BUFFER. IF
THIS CELL IS DISTURBED, RT TYPES SKIP FAULT. THIS CELL COULD BE
BY THE CHANNEL STORING ONE BEYOND THE END OF THE 620 DATA READ BUFFER.
SO SKIP FAULT ALSO TYPES WHEN THIS TYPE OF ERROR OCCURS. THE LAST WORD
OF THE 620 DISC BUFFER IS DBF+577. DBF+600 SHOULD CONTAIN 123456.

EXP,WT;G WRITES A TEST PACK TO BE LATER READ BY RT. IF EXP IS EVEN, WT 
INITIALIZES 2 LOGICAL PACKS OR 1 PHYSICAL CALCOMP PACK. WT EXITS WHEN
THE USER TYPES CONTROL S ON THE DIM TTY, OR ON AN IO ERROR WITH THE
MESSAGE IO ER, OR  WHEN IT IS DONE WORKING WITH THE MESSAGE OK. IT TAKES
WT 400 SECONDS TO RUN TO COMPLETION. WT WRITES EVEN IF WP;G HAS EXECUTED.

EXP,FORMAT;G FORMATS A CALCOMP PHYSICAL PACK IF EXP IS EVEN, OR ONE
LOGICAL 2314 PACK IF EXP IS ODD. FORMAT EXITS WHEN THE USER TYPES
CONTROL S ON THE DIM TTY, OR WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS AN IO ERROR WITH THE
MESSAGE IO ER, OR WHEN IT IS DONE WORKING WITH THE MESSAGE OK. IT TAKES
FORMAT 400 SECONDS TO RUN TO COMPLETION.

ERRORS;G TYPES THE ACCUMULATED I-O ERROR COUNT AND LISTS AS MUCH 
DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION AS HAS BEEN STORED IN A 200 WORD TABLE. EACH BAD 
I-O OPERATION IS DESCRIBED BY A TYPE OUT THAT INCLUDES CYLINDER AND HEAD
NUMBER AND THE LETTER R OR W FOR READ OR WRITE FOLLOWED BY EITHER
A CHANNEL STATUS WORD OR 6 SENSE BYTES.

RSTE;G RESETS THE ERROR COUNTER AND THE ACCUMULATED LIST OF DIAGNOSTIC
INFORMATION.

EXP,SNGN;G WILL SET THE VALUE OF THE CELL CALLED NGN (NOT GOOD N940) TO
EXP. EXP SHOULD BE -1 TO ALLOW DIM TO ACCESS BOTH 940S, 0 IF MIC 
REQUESTS CANNOT REACH 940  0, AND 1 IF MIC REQUESTS CANNOT REACH
940 1. THIS COMMAND IS USEFUL TO ENGINEERS WHEN THEY DISCONNECT
ONE OF THE 940S THAT DIM HAD DECIDED WAS A LEGAL MACHINE AND WHEN
THEY RECONNECT THAT 940.

MICT;G  DRIVES THE MIC ON A SPECIFIED 940 ASSUMING THAT THE SPECIFIED
940 IS NOT TIMESHARING. ;B AND ;X MUST BE PRESET TO TELL MICT THE
INCLUSIVE RANGE OF ADDRESSES IN THE 940 TO WRITE AND READ FROM. ;A MUST
BE PRESET IN BITS 11-15 (COUNTING LEFT TO RIGHT). THE RIGHTMOST BIT IS
ON FOR THE 940 ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER PACK NUMBERS AND OFF FOR THE
OTHER 940. BIT 14 (2) IS ON TO TEST THE MIC WITH ONE BITS ON. BIT 13 (4)
IS ON FOR A ZERO TEST. BIT 12 (10) IS ON FOR A 25252525 TEST. AND,
BIT 11 (20) IS ON FOR AN ADDRESSING TEST. IF THE MIC IS NOT READY WHEN
IT SHOULD BE, MICT TYPES "MIC UNREADY".  BAD DATA IS DESCRIBED BY A 
3 WORD TYPEOUT OF THE 940 ADDRESS AND WHAT THE DATA SHOULD BE FOLLOWED
BY THE BAD DATA.  THE ONLY NORMAL WAY TO STOP MICT IS TO TYPE A CONTROL
S.  16;A  0;B  17777;X MICT;G TESTS 16K OF THE LOWER PACKS 940 WITH
THREE DATA TEST PATTERNS, MINUS ONE, ZERO, AND 25252525.

CONTROL B FOLLOWED BY A STRING OF CHARACTERS THAT IDENTIFY A SET OF 
SELECTOR CHANNEL BITS FOLLOWED BY A BLANK OR ANY NON ALPHANUMERIC
CHARACTER TYPES OUT A BINARY STRING OF BITS TO THE USER.
THE BIT LOOKER SYMBOL TABLE MAY BE CHANGED TO ACCOMODATE NEW BIT
LOOKERS.  SEE THE COMMENT IN THE DIM SYMBOLICS AT :BLST:.

                               THE SELECTOR CHANNEL
                               --------------------

      THE SELECTOR CHANNEL IS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE XDS 940
      COMPUTER AND THE CALCOMP 215 DISC UNIT.
      WITH THE SELECTOR CHANNEL, THE SYSTEM MAY BE BROUGHT UP FOR 
      TIME-SHARING ONE OF TWO DIFFERENT WAYS, NEITHER OF WHICH REQUIRE
      THE USE OF A MAG TAPE OR PAPER TAPE UTILIZING 'DSWAP'.
      THE BASE CODE MAY ALSO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE 940 CORE INTO
      THE BASE BY MEANS OF THE SELECTOR CHANNEL.
      ASSUMING THE SELECTOR CHANNEL CODE IS ALL RIGHT AND THE SELECTOR
      CHANNEL IS RUNNING (NOT IN STEP), DO THE FOLLOWING:

           1) AT THE 940 CONSOLE, PLACE THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH IN THE
              IDLE POSITION.
           2) PRESS THE START BUTTON AND LEAVE THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH IN
              THE IDLE POSITION.
           3) MAKE SURE THAT SENSE SWITCH 2 ON THE SELECTOR CHANNEL IS
              IN THE RESET POSITION. THIS WILL SAVE THE 940 CORE SO THE
              CRASH MAY BE EXAMINED.
           4) DETERMINE THE PROPER DISC NUMBER THAT THE SYSTEM 
              SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP FROM.
           5) WITH THE OPERATOR TTY IN SELECTOR CHANNEL MODE, TYPE THE FOLLOWING:
              N,UP@

           WHERE  N  WILL BE THE PROPER DISC LOCATION. THE   @  
           INITIALIZES THE START UP PROCEDURE.

           6) AT THE 940 CONSOLE, PRESS START AND THEN PUT THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH TO:
              STEP,IDLE,RUN.
           7) THE 940 IS NOW READY TO COME UP FOR TIME-SHARING.
              PUT THE OPERATOR TTY INTO NETWORK MODE AND LOG IN.
              FROM THIS POINT FOLLOW THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
              FOR BRINGING UP THE 940.


      ANOTHER METHOD MAY BE UTILIZED TO BRING THE 215-940 SYSTEM UP
      WITHOUT USING THE SELECTOR CHANNEL TELETYPE. ALTHOUGH NOT AS 
      FAST CONCEIVABLY, THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN IT MUST BE USED.

           1) PLACE THE SELECTOR CHANNEL IN STEP BY PRESSING THE
              STEP SWITCH.
           2) AT THE SELECTOR CHANNEL, MAKE SURE THE PROPER DISC 
              LOCATION IS IN THE PROGRAM LOCATION
              017614. (SEE PROCEDURE FOR CHECKING BOOTSTRAP FOR THE
              SELECTOR CHANNELS). THE DISC LOCATION CAN BE CHANGED HERE
              BY DOING THE FOLLOWING:

              A. CLEAR ALL REGISTERS BY PLACING THE REGISTER SWITCHES
                 IN THE UP POSITION AND PRESSING THE RESET SWITCH. EACH
                 REGISTER MUST BE CLEARED SEPARATELY. RESET WILL NOT
                 TAKE EFFECT IF MORE THAN ONE REGISTER SWITCH IS IN THE
                 UP POSITION.

              B. PLACE OCTAL 054000 IN THE 'U' REGISTER. THIS
                 INSTRUCTION TELLS THE SELECTOR CHANNEL THAT IT IS
                 GOING TO STORE INTO THE LOCATION SPECIFIED BY P THAT VALUE
                 WHICH IS IN THE A REGISTER.

              C. THE 'P' REGISTER MUST NOW BE LOADED. THE CURRENT LOCATION
                 IS OCTAL 017614. PLACE THIS NUMBER IN THE
                 'P' REGISTER.

              D. PLACE THE CURRENT DISC NUMBER (OCTAL) IN THE 'A' REGISTER.

              E. PRESS THE STEP SWITCH. THIS WILL EXECUTE THE INSTRUCTION
                 AND STORE THE DISC NUMBER INTO THE PROPER PROGRAM LOCATION (017614).

              F. THE SELECTOR CHANNEL IS NOW
                 READY TO BE STARTED, BUT BEFORE DOING THIS, GO TO THE
                 940 CONSOLE AND DO THE FOLLOWING:

           3) PLACE THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH IN THE IDLE POSITION AND PRESS
              START BUTTON, LEAVING THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH IN IDLE.
           4) RESET ALL REGISTERS AT THE SELECTOR CHANNEL. SEE (A) 
              ABOVE.
           5) PLACE THE STARTING POSITION OF THE BOOTSTRAP IN THE 'P'
              REGISTER. THIS IS CURRENTLY OCTAL 017600.
           6) PRESS SYSTEM RESET TWICE
           7) PRESS RUN SWITCH.
           8) SELECTOR CHANNEL SHOULD NOW BE RUNNING.
           9) AT THE 940 CONSOLE, DO THE FOLLOWING:
             PUT THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH TO STEP,IDLE,RUN.
          10) THE 940 IS NOW READY TO COME UP FOR TIME-SHARING.
              PUT THE OPERATOR TTY INTO NETWORK MODE AND LOG IN.
              FROM THIS POINT FOLLOW THE NORMAL START UP PROCEDURES.

                               DISK MAPPING ALGORITHMS
                               -----------------------

               NEW DISC MAPPING SCHEME - JIM BLUM - 6/19/72

THE NEW MAPPING SCHEME IS NOT A COMPLETE CHANGE TO THE EXISTING
SCHEME, BUT AN ENHANCEMENT AND CONTINUATION OF IT.  THE BITMAP
(FOR BOTH DATA PRODUCTS AND CALCOMP DISCS) REMAINS THE SAME SIZE
AND FORMAT.  THE CURRENT MAPPING PROGRAM IS CHANGED TO MAP ALL MAP ZONES
AND EACH ZONE BITMAP IS WRITTEN TO THE DISC. THE PROGRAM IS RUN ONLY WHEN
THE ZONE BITMAPS ARE NOT VALID OR NEED UPDATING.  THE ZONE BITMAPS ARE
KEPT UP TO DATE BY A PROGRAM AND THE MONITOR.  DURING THE DAY THE 
PROGRAM, WHICH IS STARTED UP AT COME UP TIME AND IS AWAKENED BY THE
MONITOR, IS ALLOWED TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE MONITOR ABOUT DISC BLOCKS
RETURNED BY THE USERS VIA DELETES, ETC.  THE PROGRAM TAKES THESE
RETURNED BLOCKS AND UPDATES THE ZONE BITMAPS LOCATED ON THE DISC.

WHENEVER THE SYSTEM CRASHES, THE CRASH ROUTINE WRITES
THE CURRENT ZONE BITMAP, WHICH IT HAS IN CORE, OUT TO THE DISC
ALONG WITH SOME VALIDATION WORDS FOR LATER VERIFICATION.  WHEN THE
SYSTEM COMES BACK UP, ONE OF THE BITMAPS IS CHOSEN TO BE READ IN AND
NO MAPPING IS NECESSARY IN MOST CASES.

IN ORDER TO HANDLE THE RETURNED DISC BLOCKS, A HOLE TABLE (DHT)
IS ADDED, APPROXIMATELY 512 TO 1024 WORDS IN LENGTH, CONTAINING
ONE HOLE PER WORD. THE HOLES ARE STORED CHRONOLOGICALLY IN THE TABLE.
WHEN THE TABLE FILLS UP TO A CRITICAL POINT, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT
LESS THAN THE TOTAL AVAILABLE SPACE, THE PROGRAM IS AWAKENED BY THE
SCHEDULER ON THE ABOVE ACTIVATION CONDITION.  THE PROGRAM
THEN ISSUES A BRS WHICH COPIES THE HOLE TABLE INTO THE PROGRAM'S
MEMORY AND THE MONITOR HOLE TABLE BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR MORE RETURNED
DISC BLOCKS.  THE PROGRAM THEN TAKES THE HOLE TABLE IT RECEIVES
AND UPDATES THE OTHER ZONE BITMAPS LOCATED ON THE DISC, ONE AT A TIME.
WHENEVER THE PROGRAM DECIDES TO UPDATE A PARTICULAR ZONE, IT
ISSUES ANOTHER BRS TELLING THE MONITOR WHICH ZONE IT WOULD
LIKE TO START UPDATING, AND UPON RECEIVING CONFIRMATION FROM THE 
MONITOR, READS THE ZONE BITMAP FROM THE DISC, UPDATES IT FROM THE
HOLE TABLE IT HAS, AND THEN WRITES IT OUT TO THE DISC.
THE PROGRAM THEN REPEATS THE ABOVE STEPS FOR ALL OTHER ZONE MAPS
EXCLUDING THE ONE THE MONITOR HAS IN CORE, AND THEN DISMISSES ITSELF
ON THE HOLE TABLE FULL ACTIVATION CONDITON.

WHEN THE BITMAP, WHICH THE MONITOR IS USING, RUNS OUT OF DBITS,
THE MONITOR WRITES THE BIMAP OUT TO THE ALLOCATED DISC ADDRESS
AND DECIDES ON A NEW BITMAP TO READ IN.  IF THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY
WORKING ON A BITMAP, THE MONITOR WILL NOT CHOOSE THAT BITMAP TO
READ IN. ONE OF THE OTHER ZONE BITMAPS WILL BE READ IN.

IF THE PROGRAM PICKS A ZONE WHICH IS THE SAME ZONE THAT THE MONITOR
IS USING (WHICH COULD HAPPEN IF THE MONITOR PICKS A NEW ZONE JUST
AFTER GIVING THE PROGRAM THE CURRENT HOLE TABLE), THEN, WHEN THE PROGRAM
ISSUES THE BRS TO TELL THE MONITOR WHICH ZONE IT WANTS TO WORK ON,
THE BRS WILL NOT SKIP INDICATING THAT THE MONITOR IS WORKING ON
THAT ONE. IN THIS CASE, SINCE THERE ARE HOLES THAT THE PROGRAM
HAS IN THE HOLE TABLE IT RECEIVED WHICH NEED UPDATING,
THE PROGRAM WILL EXECUTE THE BRS TO RETURN THE HOLES BACK TO THE
MONITOR.  THE MONITOR WILL THEN PUT THESE BITS BACK INTO THE CURRENT
BITMAP.  IF, IN THE MEANTIME, THE THE MONITOR RUNS OUT OF
DBITS BEFORE THE PROGRAM HANDS THE BITS BACK TO THE IN CORE BITMAP,
THEN THE MONITOR WILL SIMPLY PUT THEM INTO THE MONITOR HOLE TABLE
AS IT GETS THEM FROM THE PROGRAM, AND EVENTUALLY, THE BLOCKS
WILL GET UPDATED.
















                               1REFRESH
                               --------

       THIS PROGRAM MAPS THE ENTIRE DISC AND WRITES THE INDIVIDUAL MAPS
TO THE DISC.  IT MUST BE RUN TO INITILIZE THE MAPPING SYSTEM AND IS
ALSO RUN WHENEVER IT IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO REFRESH THE DISC.
WHEN NECESSARY, 1REFRESH IS RUN BEFORE THE SYSTEM MAP IS SET
(SEE 1SETMAP BELOW.)  IF THE SYSTEM MAP HAS BEEN SET IT IS NECESSARY
TO TAKE THE SYSTEM DOWN AND BRING IT UP AGAIN BEFORE RUNNING 1REFRESH.

       THE DISC MUST BE REFRESHED PERIODICALLY FOR THE FOLLOWING
REASONS:

  1.  BAD MAPS

       IF THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN OR IS TAKEN DOWN WITHOUT INVOLKING THE
MONITOR'S CRASH ROUTINES, THE IN-CORE DISC MAP IS NOT WRITTEN BACK
ONTO THE DISC.  AS THE KEY WORD IN THE DISC VERSION OF THIS MAP WAS
SET TO ZERO WHEN FIRST READ INTO CORE IT IS KEYED AS A BAD MAP.  THIS
WILL OCCUR IF THE SYSTEM DOES DOWN DUE TO A POWER FAILURE, IF IT IS
HUNG IN A LOOP MAKING BREAKPOINT SWITCH 4 INEFECTIVE, OR IF THE
OPERATOR TAKES THE SYSTEM DOWN BY USE OF THE RUN-IDLE-STEP SWITCH.
IS IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE OPERATOR ALWAYS TAKE THE SYSTEM DOWN USING
THE EXECUTIVE CRASH COMMAND.

  2.  GRADUAL LOSS OF DBITS

       ALL DBITS MAY NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISC VERSIONS OF THE MAPS
DUE TO:

       A.  UNPROCESSED DBITS IN THE MONITOR TABLE WHEN THE SYSTEM IS
           TAKEN DOWN.
       B.  CANCELLING USERS.  WHEN A USER IS CANCELLED HIS FILE DIR-
           ECTORY IS ERASED, HOWEVER, THE DELETE LOGIC IS NOT INVOLKED
           AND THE DBITS ARE NOT RECOVERED UNTIL THE NEXT DISC
           REFRESH.

       1REFRESH WILL REQUIRE FROM 20 MINUTES TO 45 MINUTES TO RUN
DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF FILES ON THE DISC.  A TYPICAL RUN OF
1REFRESH WOULD BE:

-1REFRESH  (CR)

NO. OF FILES:  5793

CONFLICT AT  55000174

TYPE YES TO DELETE BAD FILES  YES (CR)

DBITS:  0,5238
DBITS:  1,6803
DBITS:  2,561
DBITS:  3,523

DBITS:  5,0
DBITS:  6,0
DBITS:  7,0
EOJ
-

       IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RUNNING 1REFRESH DOES NOT SET THE SYSTEM
FLAG TO BEING MAPPED.  1SETMAP MUST BE RUN AFTER THE DISC IS REFRESHED
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.















                               1SETMAP
                               -------

           1) ESTABLISHES THE ROTATION FILE IF IT FINDS THAT THE FILE
              IS NOT UNDER USER NUMBER 1 AS  "RAWACT".

           2) SETMAP LOCATES THE POINT IN THE FILE WHERE THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING
              IS TO BE WRITTEN, AND PROVIDES THE EXEC WITH A TABLE OF DATA BLOCK
              ADDRESSES FOR THIS PURPOSE.

           3) TO PREVENT WRITING OVER PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING THE SETMAP PREVENTS
              THE SYSTEM FROM OPERATING IF START UP TIME PREVIOUS
              TO THE LAST RECORDED ACCOUNTING TIME IS ATTEMPTED.

           4) THE SETMAP PRINTS A WARNING MESSAGE IF THE START UP TIME IS
              GREATER THAN 20 MINUTES AFTER THE LAST RECORED ACCOUNTING
              TIME. OR START UP TIME MORE THAN 8 HOURS GREATER WILL PRINT OUT
              OR ANY OTHER TIME IT IS APPROPRIATE. MESSAGE  WILL ALWAYS BE PRINTED
              WHEN THE ACCOUNTING FILE IS NEWLY CREATED AND THE LAST RECORDED TIME IS ZERO
               SEE PAGE 67.

           5) 1SETMAP IS RUN IMMEDIATELY AFTER BRINGING THE SYSTEM UP
              UNLESS IT IS DESIRED TO REFRESH THE DISC, IN WHICH CASE, IT IS RUN
              IMMEDIATELY AFTER 1REFRESH.  1SETMAP READS THE MAPS FROM THE DISC
              AND PROVIDES THE MONITOR WITH THE NUMBER OF DBITS IN EACH, IT ALSO
              TELLS THE MONITOR IF ANY OF THE MAPS ARE BAD.  1SETMAP ALSO SETS
              THE ACCOUNTING POINTERS AND BUILDS THE EXECUTIVE'S OVERFLOW 
              FILE DIRECTORY BIT MAP.  UPON COMPLETION IT ISSUES AN UP AND 
              STARTS THE COMMAND FILE (OPER)OPCOM, WHICH RUNS 1WSD.

PURPOSE: TO CONSOLIDATE ALL FILE DIRECTORIES, TO FREE UP
         OVERFLOW DIRECTORIES, AND TO SPEED DISC ACCESS TO THE
         USERS.



EXPLANATION:
------------
THE CAD PROGRAM CONSOLIDATES ALL THE FILE DIRECTORIES ON THE DISK. CAD 
COMPLETELY REWRITES THE DISK DIRECTORY AND SETS ALL UNUSED AREAS TO ZERO
WHILE COMPACTING ALL DIRECTORIES. THE PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY TAKING
A FILE DIRECTORY FROM A NEWLY MADE FILE (MADE BY THE 1CAD PROGRAM)
AND COMBINING THIS DIRECTORY WITH THE EXISTING DIRECTORY ON THE DISK.

     1. CAD TAKES THE FILE DIRECTORY FROM THE NEWLY MADE FILE
        AND TREATS IT AS THE MASTER FILE DIRECTORY. IF A FILE LOCATED IN
        THE MASTER FILE CANNOT BE FOUND ON THE DISK, THE MASTER FILE DIR.
        ENTRY IS GIVEN A ZERO INDEX BLOCK POINTER.

     2. THE PROGRAM SETS THE CHANGED FILE FLAG TO ZERO IN BOTH FILE
        DIRECTORIES.

     3. EVERY FILE DIRECTORY GROUP THAT IS RESTORED FROM TAPE OR READ
        FROM THE NEWLY CREATED FILE IS FLAGGED SO THAT UNFLAGGED GROUPS
        CAN BE SET TO ZERO. THESE FLAGS ARE REMOVED BEFORE CAD IS EXITED.

     4. FILE DIRECTORY ENTRIES ARE NOT RETAINED UNLESS THEY ARE ON THE
        NEWLY CREATED(MASTER) FILE DIRECTORY. IN OTHER
        WORDS, A FILE DIRECTORY ENTRY THAT IS ON THE DISK BUT NOT ON THE
        "MASTER" DIRECTORY IS DELETED.



OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------------
1. DUMP OR PACKCOPY THE ENTIRE DISC BEFORE RUNNING THE 1CAD PROGRAM TO
   INSURE BACKUP IN CASE THE PROGRAM MALFUNCTIONS.

2. BRING THE SYSTEM UP.

3. SET OPERATOR STATUS.

4. ***RUN 1SETMAP***

   NOTE: IF 1SETMAP IS NOT RUN AND 1CAD IS ATTEMPTED, THE DATA ON THE
         DISC WILL BE DESTROYED AND THE DISC WILL HAVE TO BE RELOADED
         WITH THE DUMP JUST TAKEN OR THE PACKCOPY JUST TAKEN WILL HAVE
         TO BE PUT IN THE DISC DRIVES TO ENABLE THE SYSTEM TO COME UP.
         1COP, D OPTION WILL BE RUN FOR YOU BY THE OPCOM FILE. LET IT
         RUN TO COMPLETION.

5. IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE LINES AND HANG ANY USERS THAT MAY HAVE GOTTEN
   ON THE SYSTEM INCLUDING PJ AND MAP.

6. CHECK TO SEE IF ANY ERRORS OTHER THAN BAD FILES APPEARED ON THE 1COP
   D OPTION OUTPUT UPON THE RUNNING OF 1SETMAP. IF ERRORS APPEARED DO NOT
   TRY TO RUN 1CAD.

7. CREATE A NEW MASTER FILE DIRECTORY BY RUNNING ()GMKFD.

8.  IN THE EXECUTIVE TYPE    -1CAD
    FOR ERROR MESSAGES SEE OUTPUT BELOW.

    THE PROGRAM WILL TELL YOU THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT TO BE RUN UNLESS
    THE DISC HAS JUST BEEN DUMPED OR PACKCOPIED. IF IT HAS NOT, DO NOT
    ATTEMPT TO RUN 1CAD.

9.  IF ALL GOES WELL THE PROGRAM WILL TYPE   "END OF JOB".
    
    THE NEW VERSION OF 1CAD WILL ALSO GIVE INFORMATION AS TO HOW MANY
    OVERFLOW GROUPS WERE GAINED, IT ALSO USES A MASTER FILE DIRECTORY FILE
    AND THEREFORE WILL NOT ACCESS THE TAPE DRIVES.

10. ON COMPLETION OF 1CAD, RUN THE 1COP PROGRAM WITH THE D OPTION  TO
    INSURE THAT 1CAD HAS NOT CLOBBERED THE DISK OR ANY USERS. IF ANY
    ERRORS APPEAR CALL YOUR SHIFT MANAGER. NOTE: THE NEW VERSION OF 1CAD
    WILL ONLY WIPE ONE USER IF IT BOMBS OUT.

11. CRASH THE SYSTEM WITH THE CRASH COMMAND AND BRING THE SYSTEM UP AS
    NORMAL. NOTE: THIS MUST BE DONE TO INSURE THAT USER MAP IS LOGGED
    ONTO THE SYSTEM.

12. 1CAD SHOULD BE RUN AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK TO KEEP USER DISC ACCESS
    TIME DOWN AND TO FREE UP OVERFLOW GROUPS.

13. IF TRYING TO RUN 1CAD ON A SUPERVISOR SYSTEM BE SURE THAT THE SUPERVISOR
    IS SUPPRESSED WHILE RUNNING 1CAD.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

THE PROGRAM MAY BE RUN WITH MORE THEN ONE USER ON THE SYSTEM,
AND WILL ALWAYS CLEAR THE SAME ZONE UNTIL THE CLEARED ZONE IS MAPPED.
THEN THE PROGRAM WILL CLEAR THE NEXT ZONE. THE PROGRAM PROCESSES USER
NUMBERS CONSECUTIVELY, TYPING THE USER NUMBER FOR EACH FILE TRANSFERRED,
AND AN ASTERISK FOR EACH FILE TRANSFERRED. IF, DURING A SINGLE RUN OF
THE PROGRAM, THE USER NUMBERS ARE CYCLED, THE PROGRAM WILL COME TO
COMPLETION. IF THE USER NUMBERS ARE NOT CYCLED DURING A SINGLE RUN, 
THE LAST USER NUMBER WILL BE REMEMBERED AND PROCESSING WILL BEGIN AT
THE NEXT NUMBER ON A SUBSEQUENT RUN. WHEN THE MAP ZONE CURRENTLY
MAPPED BECOMES FULL, THE PROGRAM WILL COME TO COMPLETION. IF DESIRED
, THE SYSTEM MAY BE REMAPPED ON  ANOTHER ZONE (OTHER THAN THE ONE
BEING CLEARED),  BY RUNNING THE REMAP PROGRAM.
       

       SAMPLE RUN:

MESSAGE   END OF JOB WILL BE TYPED.










                        BACKING UP THE DISC
                        -------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

THE PURPOSE IN 'BACKING UP THE DISC' IS TO MAKE SURE THAT DUPLICATE
COPIES OF THE FILE SYSTEM EXIST OFF THE LINE IN CASE A USER MISTAKENLY
DELETES HIS FILES, OF IF SOME PROBLEM OCCURS ON THE DISC, WE HAVE THE
MEANS TO RECOVER FILES, DIRECTORIES, OR THE ENTIRE FILE SYSTEM.  THE
THREE BACKUP TECHNIQUES THAT ARE USED AT WCO ARE:

        1.  DAILY BACKUP (SEE 'SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES')
            ------------

            A.  '1STORE' IS RUN EVERY NIGHT USING THE 'BACKUP' OPTION.
THIS PROGRAM WILL BE STARTED ONE AND ONE-HALF HOUR BEFORE SCHEDULED
SHUTDOWN AND IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROCEDURES.  AFTER 
ACCOUNTING IS RUN, '1STORE' IS TO BE RUN A SECOND TIME SO THE ACCOUNT-
ING OUTPUT CAN ALSO BE BACKED UP TO TAPE.

            B.  DAILY BACKUP TAPES ARE TO BE KEPT FOR 31 DAYS AND THEN
ROTATED.  (FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUGUST 2 BACKUP OVERWRITES THE BACKUP 
STORED ON JULY 2).

        2.  WEEKLY BACKUP (SEE '1PACKCOPY PROCEDURES')
            -------------

            A.  A PACKCOPY SHOULD BE RUN ON EACH SYSTEM EVERY WEEK.
THIS IS SCHEDULED FOR SWINGS AND GRAVE SHIFTS OR WHEN DIRECTED BY
THE SHIFT MANAGER.

            B.  TWO BACKUP PACKCOPY SETS ARE RETAINED FOR EACH SYSTEM
IN ADDITION TO THE RUNNING SET.

            C.  THE STATUS BOARD SHOULD BE UPDATED AFTER THE PACKCOPY
IS COMPLETED.  THE TTY OUTPUT FROM THE PACKCOPY PROGRAM SHOULD BE
KEPT WITH THE SET THAT WAS COPIED FROM.  THIS SHOULD INCLUDE THE DATE
AND TIME OF THE PACKCOPY AND NOTATION AS TO WHICH PACK SET WAS
COPIED TO WHICH.

        3.  BI-WEEKLY BACKUP (SEE '1STORE' DOCUMENT)
            ----------------

            A.  A '1STORE', USING THE 'ALL' OPTION, SHOULD BE RUN
ON EACH SYSTEM EVERY TWO WEEKS.  THESE BI-WEEKLY ALL FILES ARE STARTED
SATURDAY MORNING BY GRAVE SHIFT AFTER ALL OTHER BATCH REQUESTS HAVE
BEEN COMPLETED.  THE STATUS BOARD SHOULD BE UPDATED AFTER THE 'ALL FILES'
OPERATIONS IS COMPLETED ON EACH SYSTEM.  THE OLDEST 'ALL FILES' SET
WILL ALWAYS BE WRITTEN OVER.

            B.  A TOTAL OF SIX 'ALL FILES' SETS ARE MAINTAINED FOR
EACH SYSTEM.

RESPONSIBILITY
--------------

        IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SWING AND GRAVE SHIFT MANAGER
TO COORDINATE AND SCHEDULE THE ALL FILES AND PACKCOPIES.  WHEN THESE
JOBS HAVE BEEN DONE, THE OPERATOR SHOULD PUT A COMPLETED 'DOT' ON
THE MAG BOARD FOR THE JOB.















                               DISK REBUILD PROCEDURE
                               ----------------------



PURPOSE:   TO INSURE THE LEAST LOSS OF DATA IN THE EVENT
           OF A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE DISC.


1)         BEFORE PROCEEDING TO RESTORING THE DISC, ENSURE THAT
           THE ACCOUNTING HAS BEEN SAVED OR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HAS
           BEEN DUMPED. WHEN NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE PRESENT
           STATE OF THE DISC FILE, GET CLEARANCE FROM SHIFT
           MANAGER BEFORE PROCEEDING.

2)         RELOAD THE LATEST DUMP AND BRING THE SYSTEM UP.
           DO NOT ANSWER THE LINES!!!! REMOVE THE WRITE RINGS
           FROM ALL THE TAPES INVOLVED.

3)         RELOAD THE LATEST LUD FILE FROM USER#1 AND SET THE LUD I.E.


-1OPER

* SET LUD

NAME: OPERNAME

PASSWORD: OPERPASSWORD

-

4)          RUN THE GMKFD PROGRAM LOCATED IN USER#1, I.E. GO ()GMKFD
4A)         RUN THE LIBRARY F.D. CONTROL PROGRAM (UTIL)FDC TO DECLARE LIBRARY DIRECTORIES PROPERLY.

5)          RESTORE THE LATEST GOOD ROTATING ACCOUNTING FILE (RAWACT).
            THIS WILL CRASH THE SYSTEM.

6)          RELOAD ALL BACKUP TAPES FROM THE DUMP TO THE PRESENT. START
            WITH THE OLDEST FIRST AND EXCLUDE USER#1 ON THE RESTORE.

7)          RUN THE 1DEF PROGRAM WITH THE LATEST BACKUP TAPE MOUNTED
            ON UNIT ZERO. THIS WILL READ THE F.D. TRAILER AND DELETE ANY
            FILES FROM THE DISK THAT ARE NOT LOCATED ON THE TRAILER.
            BE CAREFUL!!!!  LATEST F.D. TRAILER MAY REFLECT A
            CLOBBERED DISK. CONSULT WITH THE SHIFT MANAGER ON WHICH IS
            THE LATEST KNOWN GOOD F.D. TRAILER, RELOAD BACKUPS, RUN 1DEF
            WITH THE LATEST GOOD TRAILER THEN ANY REMAINING BACKUPS.

8)          RUN THE 1FLAGOFF PROGRAM TO PREVENT BACKUP FROM PICKING UP ALL
            OF THE FILES YOU JUST RESTORED.

9)          NOTIFY ALL THE DISTRICTS CONCERNED USING IMS MAIL SPECIFYING
            THE DATES OF ALL TAPES INVOLVED.

10)         MAKE ENTRIES IN THE SYSTEM LOG AND THE SHIFT LOG AS TO WHICH
            TAPES WERE RESTORED.

11)         SAVE ALL TELETYPE OUTPUT.

                               REPORTING SYSTEM CRASHES
                               ------------------------


PURPOSE: TO PROVIDE A POLICY ON REPORTING SYSTEM CRASHES

PROCEDURE: 
        
        REPORTS
        -------

        1. EVERY CRASH MUST BE REPORTED IN THE SYSTEM LOG AND THE SHIFT MANAGER NOTIFIED.

        2. PRIOR TO SYSTEM SHUT DOWN, THE SHIFT MANAGER WILL GENERATE THE APPROPRIATE MAR
           IN THE TYMSHARE/MAINTENANCE LOG. IF THE SYSTEM HAS MONCRS, THIS ALSO
           WILL BE ENTERED IN THE TYM/MAINT LOG.

        3. SEPARATE MAR MUST BE GENERATED FOR EACH SPECIFIC PROBLEM.

        4. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SHIFT MANAGER TO ENSURE THAT ALL CRASHES
           THAT APPEAR TO BE SOFTWARE  RELATED ARE REPORTED TO OPERATIONS PROGRAMMING
           SO THAT CORRECTIVE ACTION MAY BE TAKEN.

        5. WHENEVER A SYSTEM IS RELEASED FOR MAINTENANCE, THE DATE AND TIME MUST BE RECORDED
           ON THE MAR.


        CRITERIA FOR RELEASING SYSTEM TO TYM/MAINT DURING PRIME TIME
        ------------------------------------------------------

        1. MEMORY PARITY/I/O PARITY (P=100 OR 76)

           A. ALLOW TYM/MAINT CUSTOMER ENGINEER TO SEARCH CORE FOR BAD PARITY.
           B. TAKE SYSTEM OUT OF INTERLEAVING.

        2. DISC HANGUP

           A. SEEK ERRORS/WRITE MONITOR ERROR. GET DISC ADDRESS-BRING SYSTEM UP.
           B. STATE 4-GET DISC ADDRESS, ALLOW TYM/MAINT TO CHECK THE DISC. NO DISK
              DIAGNOSTICS ARE TO BE RUN UNLESS THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DUMPED OR AT LEAST THE
              DISK IN QUESTION.

        3. MONITOR CRASH (P=77)
   
           A. IF SYSTEM CRASHES TWICE IN ONE HOUR, ALLOW TYM/MAINT TO CHECK FOR OBVIOUS
              PROBLEMS.

        4. AFTER TWO CRASHES

           IF THE SYSTEM HAS CRASHED FOR KNOWN OR SUSPECTED HARDWARE REASONS, TYM/MAINT
           WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THEIR DIAGNOSTICS. IF NO FAILURES ARE
           DETECTED AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES, THE SYSTEM WILL BE BROUGHT BACK
           UP AT THE DISCRETION OF THE SHIFT MANAGER.

                               THE RAW ACCOUNTING FILE
                               -----------------------

      THE ROTATING ACCOUNTING FILE IS LOCATED UNDER USER NUMBER 1
      AND CONTAINS ALL ACCOUNTING INFORMATION ALONG WITH STASTICAL
      INFORMATION. THE ROTATING ACCOUNTING FILE WILL HOLD UP TO APPROXIMATELY 5 DAYS
      OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND WHEN THE AREA BECOMES FULL IT
      SIMPLY ROTATES AND STARTS AT THE BEGINNING AND STARTS REWRITING
      THE INFORMATION ON THE STARTING LOCATION OF THE ROTATION FILE.


      PACKAGES TO MAINTAIN AND CONVERT THE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION
      FROM THE ROTATION FILE ARE 1SETMAP,1STORAGE AND 1GASP.
NOTE: A POSSIBLE PROBLEM AREA EXISTS IN A CARELESS ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS
      START-UP TIMES BY OPERATORS. AS STATED ABOVE, THE MAP WILL PREVENT
      RUNNING WITH A TIME PREVIOUS TO THE LAST RECORDED TIME; HOWEVER;
      THERE IS NO PRACTICAL WAY TO PREVENT START-UP TIMES LATER THAN THE
      ACTUAL TIME. IT IS APPARENT THAT IF A LATE START-UP TIME IS ENTERED
      THAT TAKING THE SYSTEM DOWN AND BRINGING IT BACK UP WITH THE CORRECT
      TIME PREVENTS PROBLEMS BECAUSE ACCOUNTING WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED
      WHICH WOULD BE SUBSEQUENT TO THE NEW START-UP TIME. IF THIS PROBLEM
      ARISES,  THE OPERATION MANAGER SHOULD FOLLOW THESE STEPS:


           1) RENAME THE ROTATING ACCOUNTING FILE BY RUNNING THE
              1RENAME PROGRAM. (SEE WRITEUP IN THIS MANUAL).

           2) TAKE THE SYSTEM DOWN BY USING THE CRASH PROGRAM AND
              BRING IT BACK UP WITH THE CORRECT START-UP TIME.
              (1SETMAP WILL PRINT OUT A MESSAGE THAT THE RAWACT FILE IS 
              MISSING-THIS IS NORMAL. AND A NEW RAWACT FILE WILL BE MADE).

           3) CONTACT TECH. DIVISION FOR ASSISTANCE IN RECOVERING
              THE ACCOUNTING FROM THE RENAMED ROTATING ACCOUNTING FILE.

INTRODUCTION
------------

        THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO CALL ALL THE PROGRAMS OR PROGRAM
CHAINS IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WHICH ARE IN THE FILE DIRECTORIES
OF (*4ACCT) AND (*4PROG).  IT ALSO WRITES OUT THEIR RESTART FILES.
1ACCOUNTING CAN ONLY BE USED BY A PERSON WITH DISTRICT STATUS OF
ZERO.

        EVERY EVENING, PRIOR TO TAKEDOWN, 1STORAGE, 1GASP AND 
1ACCOUNTING IS RUN (SEE 1STORAGE AND 1GASP DOCUMENTATION ELSEWHERE
IN THIS MANUAL).  THESE TWO PROGRAMS OUTPUT FILES WHICH MUST BE PRE-
SENT BEFORE 1ACCOUNTING CAN BE RUN.

        1ACCOUNTING OUTPUTS INFORMATION TO THE OPERATOR'S TTY PER-
TAINING TO BILLABLE TIME, TOTAL TIME, BILLABLE CPU, TOTAL CPU, AND
TOTAL LOGOUTS.

        THIS INFORMATION IS TO BE SAVED ON THE TTY PAPER AND PUT IN
THE APPRORPIATE FOLDER IN THE BATCH CONTROL AREA.

                        1ENTRY PROGRAM
                        --------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

        THE 1ENTRY PROGRAM IS USED TO CHECK IF A USER IS IN THE LUD
(LOCAL USER DIRECTORY) ON A SPECIFIED SYSTEM. IF SO, IT CAN TRANSLATE
A USERNAME TO A FILE DIRECTORY NUMBER (FD#). THIS CAN BE USEFUL WHEN SEARCHING
THROUGH BACKUP TAPES FOR COPIES OF A USERS FILES; OR IF THE PROGRAM
CALL IS TERMINATED BY A LINEFEED IT CAN ACCEPT A FD# OR UUN (UNIVERSAL USER
NUMBER) AS INPUT AND PROVIDE THE USERNAME THAT CORRESPONDS TO THAT NUMBER.

        1ENTRY CAN BE USED IF YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A CERTAIN
USERNAME HAS THE SAME FD# ON ONE SYSTEM AS IT HAS ON ANOTHER SYSTEM - AND
THUS, SHOULD A TRANSLATION USED FOR A RESTORING THE FILE(S).  AFTER A RESTORE
HAS BEEN COMPLETED, THE 1RESTORE PROGRAM OUTPUTS A PAIR OF NUMBERS : 'P,N'
WHERE 'N' IS THE FD# WHERE THE FILE AT TAPE POSITION 'P' WAS RESTORED;
1ENTRY CAN BE USED HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT FD# CORRESPONDS
TO THE CORRECT DESTINATION DIRECTORY.

GENERAL INFORMATION

THE COMPANY NETWORK OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS IS CONTROLLED BY  
A NETWORK SUPERVISOR, WHICH MUST HAVE AVAILABLE TO IT A 
MASTER FILE OF ALL USERS AND THEIR PASSWORDS.  THIS FILE
IS CALLED THE MUD.  SEVERAL XDS 940 COMPUTERS HAVE   
SUPERVISORS ON THEM, ONLY ONE IS ACTIVE, THE OTHER ARE  
"ASLEEP" BUT WILL "AWAKE" AND TAKE OVER THE NETWORK IF  
THE SYSTEM CONTAINING A "SENIOR" SUPERVISOR CRASHES. ONLY  
THE MUD ON THE SYSTEM CONTAINING THE "TOP DOG" SUPERVISOR  
MAY BE CHANGED BY 1UPDATE, AND A DETACHED PROCESS PROGRAM  
UPDATES THE MUDS ON THE OTHER SYSTEMS. THUS, IF THE "TOP
DOG" SYSTEM IS DOWN, UPDATING OF USER INFORMATION IS IM-
POSSIBLE.  ADDITIONALLY, EACH SYSTEMS HAS A LOCAL USER  
DIRECTORY CALLED LUD.  THIS USER DIRECTORY IS USED BY THE  
EXECUTIVE TO KEEP TRACK OF USERS ON A GIVEN SYSTEM.  THIS  
LOCAL USER DIRECTORY ALSO CONTAINS THE FILE DIRECTORY
POINTERS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH USER.

WHILE IT IS NO LONGER USED BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE
CURRENT ACCOUNTING PACKAGE REQUIRES THAT THE ACCOUNT USER  
DIRECTORY, CALLED UAD, BE MAINTAINED.  THE UAD WILL NOT BE 
REQUIRED UPON ADVENT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING SYSTEM EXPECTED 
ABOUT JANUARY 1972. 

NORMALLY THE PROGRAM WILL RE-ASK A QUESTION IF AN INVALID 
REPLY IS GIVEN.  AS IT IS POSSIBLE THE CALLER MAY BE FACED BY 
A QUESTION HE DOES NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO, HE CAN FORCE THE
THE PROGRAM BACK TO THE COMMAND DISPATCHER BY ENTERING A
QUESTION MARK AS A REPLY TO ANY YES OR NO QUESTION OR
WHENEVER THE PROGRAM IS REQUESTING A USER NAME.

PLEASE BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING 1UPDATE 
COMMANDS BEFORE USING THEM.  IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS 
PLEASE HAVE YOUR SUPERVISOR ANSWER THEM.

INTRODUCTION
------------

        (THESE PROCEDURES ARE SIMILAR ON THE PDP10'S).  THE PUR-
POSE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS:  FIRST, EXPLAIN WHAT OPERATIONS CAN DO
WITH A BATCH REQUEST; SECOND, DEFINE VARIOUS PROCEDURES AND TERMS
USED BY OPERATIONS WHEN PROCESSING A REQUEST; THIRD, SHOW GUIDE-
LINES WHICH IF USED WILL EXPEDITE A REQUEST; AND FOURTH, ANSWER
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MOST OFTEN ASKED ABOUT OPERATIONS' PROCE-
DURES.

        A PERIPHERAL PROCESSING REQUEST (PPR) IS A BATCH REQUEST
GENERATED BY A TYMSHARE PROGRAM ON THE 940 WHICH ALLOWS A USER
TO REQUEST OPERATIONS TO PERFORM A JOB INVOLVING THE USE OF
PERIPHERALS (MAG TAPE, LINE PRINTER, ETC).  THE TERM 'BATCH
REQUEST' AND 'PPR' ARE INTERCHANGEABLE.  PPRS WHICH ARE ENTERED
ON ALL HOST COMPUTERS ARE CLEARED BY A LEAD OPERATOR OR BATCH
CONTROLLER.  SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS OF A LEAD OPERATOR OR BATCH
CONTROLLER ARE TO RECORD IN A LOG EACH BATCH REQUEST FROM EVERY
SYSTEM AS IT IS CLEARED AND TO INTERPERT THE REQUEST, ASSIGN A
PRIORITY TO IT, AND FINALLY GIVE IT TO THE RESPECTIVE SYSTEM
OPERATOR TO PERFORM.  AS FAR AS OPERATIONS IS CONCERNED, ALL
BATCH REQUESTS ARE 'RUSH' JOBS.  IF A CUSTOMER ACCIDENTIALLY
DELETES A FILE HE NEEDS TO RUN A PROGRAM, AND HE IS ALL SET TO
RUN IT, THEN OBVIOUSLY HE WOULD LIKE THE FILE RESTORED WITHIN A
SHORT A TIME AS POSSIBLE.  THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN
ESTABLISHED AT WCO FOR HANDLING OF BATCH REQUESTS:

        DAY SHIFT
        ---------

        1.  RESTORES 
        2.  DEFERRED RESTORES
        3.  STORES
        4.  LISTINGS

        SWING SHIFT
        -----------

        1.  RESTORES AND LISTINGS (SPOOL JOBS)
        2.  STORES
        3.  DEFERRED RESTORES

        GRAVE SHIFT
        -----------

        1.  CARD JOBS
        2.  LISTINGS
        3.  RESTORES
        4.  DEFERRED RESTORES
        5.  STORES

        WITH THESE PRIORITIES, WE CAN USUALLY PROVIDE RESTORES
WITHIN TWO HOURS ON DAYS AND FOUR HOURS ON THE OTHER TWO SHIFTS
WHILE STILL GIVING ADEQUATE SERVICE ON LISTINGS AND CARDS.

        CUSTOMERS REQUIRING AN OCCASIONAL HIGH PRIORITY SERVICE
WILL STILL BE ABLE TO REQUEST EXPEDITING THROUGH CUSTOMER
SERVICES,

        WITHIN THE CATEGORIES, SERVICE WILL BE:  FIRST IN,
FIRST OUT.

        WHEN BATCH REQUESTS ARE NOT DONE BY THE REQUESTED TIME,
FOR WHATEVER REASON, MAIL SHOULD BE SENT INFORMING THE REQUESTOR
THAT THE REQUEST WAS DELAYED AND WHEN IT WILL BE DONE.  THIS IS
PARTICULARLY ESSENTIAL WHEN THE REQUEST IS DELAYED FOR A DAY IN
THE CASE OF CARD JOBS.  THE CUSTOMER IS FAR HAPPIER LEARNING OF A
DELAY BY MAIL RATHER THAN BY HAVING TO CALL IN.

        ANY REQUEST WHICH AN OPERATOR CANNOT DO BECAUSE IT IS
'AWAITING' SOMETHING IS STILL TO BE 'QA'D' BY THE LEAD OPERATOR/
BATCH CONTROLLER TO VERIFY INABILITY TO COMPLETE THE REQUEST AND
SATISFACTORY NOTIFICATION TO THE USER.  THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH
CONTROLLER SHOULD INITIAL THE REQUEST AS 'MAIL QA'D'.  OPERATORS
SHOULD NOT PLACE UN-'QA'D' REQUESTS IN THE 'AWAITING MAIL' FOLDERS.

(* = JOB TYPES)

                        JOB TYPE 1
                        ----------

        LISTINGS.  SPOOL SHOULD BE USED FOR LISTINGS INSTEAD OF
BATCH REQUESTS; IF A BATCH REQUEST IS USED USE THIS JOB TYPE TO
ENTER THE JOB INTO ACCOUNTING.

                        JOB TYPES 2 AND 3
                        -----------------

        THESE JOB TYPES ARE COMPLETELY DOCUMENTED IN ANOTHER
SECTION OF THIS MANUAL.

                        JOB TYPE 4
                        ----------

        THIS TYPE FALLS INTO TWO CATEGORIES; RESTORING A FILE(S)
FROM A CUSTOMER TAPE AND RECOVERING A FILE(S) FROM AN ALL FILES
OR BACKUP TAPE.  WHEN A REQUEST IS MADE TO RESTORE A FILE FROM A
CUSTOMER TAPE THE USER SHOULD BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE TRP NUMBER AND
THE TID NUMBER ON THE REQUEST.  THIS WAY OPERATIONS KNOWS 
EXACTLY WHICH TAPE, UNLESS THE USER SPECIFIES DIFFERENTLY, THE 
FILE(S) WILL BE RESTORED TO THE DIRECTORY OF THE USER WHO ENTERED
THE PPR.  IF THE FILE IS STORED ON THE CUSTOMER'S TAPE MORE THAN
ONCE, OPERATIONS WILL ALWAYS GET THE LATEST VERSION OF THE FILE,
UNLESS THE PPR SPECIFIES DIFFERENTLY.

        RECOVERING A FILE FROM A BACKUP OR ALL FILES TAPE IS A
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MATTER THAN JUST A SIMPLE RESTORE.  THE USER
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY WHEN THE FILE WAS
LAST UPDATED.  SOME USERS KEEP TRACK AND THEREFORE CAN SAY THE
EXACT DATE OF AN UPDATE FOR A PARTICULAR FILE.  AT ANY RATE, THERE
ARE MANY BACKUP TAPES AND ALL FILES TAPES TO LOOK THROUGH, AND IF
THE USER INCLUDES THE UPDATE/CREATION DATE OF A FILE, IT CAN BE
RECOVERED MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN LOOKING THROUGH TWO WEEKS OF BACKUP
TAPES.  IF A FILE WHICH A CUSTOMER WANTS RECOVERED HAS NOT BEEN UP-
DATED IN A LONG TIME, (I. E. AN IML DESCRIPTION FILE), THEN THE USER
SHOULD SAY SO ON THE PPR AND TELL THE OPERATOR THAT THE FILE CAN
BE RECOVERED FROM ANY ALL FILES TAPE.  RESTORES AND RECOVERIES
ARE DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALMOST ALL SUCH JOBS SHOULD
BE DONE WITHIN TWO TO FOUR HOURS.  THE LENGTH OF TIME IS DIRECTLY
RELATED TO SYSTEM LOAD, AND THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS PENDING FOR
THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM.  USERS SHOULD ENTER REQUESTS SEVERAL HOURS
BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY NEED THE FILE(S).  STORE JOBS MAY TAKE UP 
TO EIGHT HOURS TO COMPLETE.

                        JOB TYPE 5
                        -----------

        STORING ON TAPE IS EASILY DONE AS LONG AS THE TRP NUMBER
AND TID NUMBER FOR THE PROPER TAPE IS SUBMITTED.  IT HELPS TOO
IF THE FILE DIRECTORY WHICH CONTAINS THE FILE IS GIVEN.
IF WHILE STORING FILES ON TAPE THE CUSTOMER'S TAPE BECOMES FULL,
THEN CONTINUE WITH A NEW TAPE, ASSIGN A TRP AND TID NUMBER TO IT
AND ADVISE THE CUSTOMER THAT A NEW TAPE WAS ASSIGNED.  THE CUSTOMER
CAN OF COURSE SUPPLY HIS OWN TAPE IF HE SO DESIRES.  THE TAPE
LIBRARY SYSTEM ALLOWS A CUSTOMER THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TAPE
FOR HIS OWN USE AND HAVE OPERATIONS TAKE CARE OF THE TAPE. A
TAPE CAN BE REQUESTED BY A USER JUST BY ENTERING A BATCH REQUEST
SAYING THAT HE WOULD LIKE A TAPE SET UP FOR HIS USE.  OPERA-
TIONS WILL THEN ASSIGN A TAPE, PERFORM THE WORK ON THE 
REQUEST AND INFORM THE USER BY SYSTEM MAIL OF HIS TRP AND TID
NUMBER.  A FEATURE WORTH NOTING HERE IS THAT A TAPE DIRECTORY
OF ANY TAPE CAN BE MADE TO A FILE AND PLACED IN A DIRECTORY
SO THE USER CAN SEE WHAT IS ON A TAPE OR TAPES WHICH BELONG 
TO HIM.  FILES ARE ALWAYS STORED TWICE ON TAPE AS AN ADDED
SECURITY MEASURE.

                        JOB TYPE 6
                        ----------

        SOME TIMES USERS WILL ENTER A BATCH REQUEST TO CHECK ON
THE STATUS OF A JOB, OR TO ASK SOME OTHER QUESTION.  THESE ARE
NOT PROPER JOB TYPES AND THEREFORE THE BATCH PROGRAM SHOULD
NOT BE USED FOR SUCH PURPOSES.  IF A USER USES A BATCH REQUEST
IN THIS WAY, THE REQUEST SHOULD BE VOIDED AND THE USER SHOULD BE 
ENCOURAGED TO SEND MAIL TO OPER.

        OTHER DO'S AND DONT'S FOR JOB TYPE 6.

        DO NOT CHARGE FOR A REQUEST THAT IS REALY MAIL; I. E., A
REQUEST THAT DOES NOT ASK YOU TO ACTUALLY TRANSFER DATA.  SIMPLY
VOID SUCH A REQUEST.

        IF A CUSTOMER ASKS FOR A REQUEST TO BE VOIDED AND IT HAS
NOT YET BEEN DONE, DO NOT CHARGE FOR THE REQUEST.  VOID IT.

        IF A CUSTOMER ASKS THAT AN ALREADY COMPLETED REQUEST BE
VOIDED, HE IS TO BE CHARGED REGARDLESS.  SEND HIM MAIL THAT YOU
HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED THE REQUEST AND CANNOT VOID IT.

        IGNORE ALL STATEMENTS IN BATCH REQUESTS THAT SAY "DO NOT
CHARGE".

        REQUESTS ENTERED BY IN-HOUSE PERSONNEL THAT INVOLVE CUSTOMER
FILES ARE TO BE CHARGED TO THE IN-HOUSE NAME, NOT THE CUSTOMER.  
HOWEVER, A COPY OF THE REQUEST IS TO BE MADE AND GIVEN TO THE SHIFT
MANAGER.  DO NOT VOID THE REQUEST; SIMPLY CHARGE IT TO THE IN-
HOUSE USER.

                        JOB TYPE 7
                        ----------

        TAPE CONVERSIONS ARE USUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT TO
PERFORM OF ALL JOB TYPES.  IN ORDER TO CONVERT A TAPE MUCH
INFORMATION IS NEEDED SO IT CAN BE DONE THE FIRST TIME.  FRE-
QUENTLY, ERRONEOUS INFORMATION IS GIVEN, OR NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION
IS GIVEN TO CONVERT A TAPE AND WHEN THIS OCCURS THE PPR IS SENT
TO CUSTOMER SERVICES WHO MUST CALL THE USER TO FIND OUT THE NECES-
SARY INFORMATION.  THIS RESULTS IN A DELAY IN PROCESSING.  THE
INFORMATION NEEDED TO EASILY AND CORRECTLY CONVERT A TAPE IS:

        DENSITY (6250,1600,800,556,200) (6250/1600 NOT AVAILA-
                                         BLE ON THE 940)
        TRACKS (7 OR 9)                 (9 TRACK NOT AVAILA-
                                         BLE ON THE 940)
        PARITY (ODD OR EVEN)
        CODE (BCD,ASCII,ETC)
        NUMBER OF CHARACTERS PER RECORD
        BLOCKING FACTOR
        HEADER INFORMATION
        NUMBER OF TAPE FILES

(SEE MAGCON ((TAPE CONV)) PART OF THIS MANUAL FOR FURTHER
 INFORMATION ON TAPE CONVERSIONS)

        ALL TAPES SENT TO WCO BY CUSTOMERS TO BE READ INTO THE
COMPUTERS SHOULD BE HELD FOR ONE WEEK TO PERMIT US TO REDO THE
JOB SHOULD THE CUSTOMER DISCOVER A PROBLEM IN THAT TIME.

        TAPES SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED TO THE CUSTOMER UNTIL THE
WEEK HAS ELAPSED.  THEY SHOULD BE HELD IN THE MAIL ROOM MARKED
'DELAY BEFORE MAILING'.  A COPY OF THE BATCH REQUEST SHOULD
INDICATE MAILING DATE.

                        UNITED KINGDOM BATCH
                        --------------------

        TYCOM X:  ENTERED THE SAME AS A REGULAR REQUEST.

        TYCOM IX:  REQUESTS FOR TYMSHARE UNITED KINGDOM LIMITED
(T.U.K.L.) WILL BE BILLED UNDER THE DISTRICT NUMBER 180.  WHEN
A USER NAME APPEARS ON A BATCH REQUEST WITH THIS DISTRICT
NUMBER AND THE JOB IS A MAG TAPE RESTORE OR STORE, THE NUMBER OF
CHARACTERS SHOULD BE RECORDED ON THE BATCH REQUEST AT THE TIME OF
COMPLETION BY THE OPERATOR.  WHEN ENTERING THESE REQUESTS INTO 
THE BATCH ACCOUNTING, ENTER '8' AS THE JOB TYPE WHEN PROMPTED.
THE PROGRAM WILL THEN ASK FOR THE VOLUME AT WHICH TIME THE NUMBER
OF CHARACTERS STORED TO TAPE OR RESTORED FROM TAPE SHOULD BE 
INPUT.  AFTER ASKING IF ALL ENTRIES ARE CORRECT, THE PROGRAM WILL
THEN ASK FOR RATE PER 100,000 CHARACTERS.  AT THIS TIME, THE 
INPUT WILL BE '4' IN REPLY TO THIS PROMPT.

                        FRENCH  BATCH
                        -------------

        TYCOM X:  ENTERED THE SAME AS A REGULAR REQUEST.

        TYCOM IX:  THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES APPLY TO WCO OPERA-
TORS WHEN HANDLING FRENCH REQUESTS.  CEGOS-TYMSHARE WILL PROVIDE
THE CHARACTER COUNT AND MAIL FOR THEIR FRENCH CUSTOMERS BY FRENCH
OPERATORS.  FOR ALL STORE JOBS, THE FILES WILL BE PUT IN THE
COPYBATCH DIRECTORY BY THE CUSTOMER.  OPERATORS IN PARIS WILL
GET THE CHARACTER COUNT THEN SUBMIT A BATCH REQUEST.  FOR ALL
RESTORES, WCO OPERATORS WILL RESTORE ALL THE FILES TO THE 
P14BATCH DIRECTORY ON THE APPROPRIATE SYSTEM.  MAIL SHOULD BE SENT
RIGHT AWAY TO USER FBATCH ON THAT SYSTEM.  PARIS WILL HANDLE THE
REST.  WCO OPERATORS WILL VOID REQUEST WHEN COMPLETED.
ALL FRENCH BATCH REQUESTS WILL BE GIVEN TOP PRIORITY.


                        BATCH COMPLETION
                        ----------------

        AFTER A BATCH REQUEST HAS BEEN COMPLETED THE OPERATOR SIGNS
AND DATES THE REQUEST.  NEXT THE BCHARGE PROGRAM SHOULD BE RUN.  
THIS PROGRAM ACCEPTS INPUTS CONCERNING THE WORK THAT WAS JUST COM-
PLETED AND IS INDEXED BY THE PPR (PERIPHERAL PROCESSING REQUEST) NUM-
BER.  THE FILE (*1BATCH)PARCHG.DAT IS SEARCHED FOR THE REQUEST NUMBER
AND, ONCE THE BCHARGE RUN HAS BEEN COMPLETED, THE FINISHED ACCOUNTING
INFORMATION IS OUTPUT TO (*1BATCH)BATONN.MON WHERE NN IS THE SYSTEM
NUMBER AND MON IS THE ABBREVIATED MONTH.

        IF THE REQUEST HAS NOT BEEN ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING, IT
SHOULD BE 'QA'D' BY THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER AND THEN
FILED IN THE SYSTEM FOLDER FOR 'BCHARGE DUE' REQUESTS.  IF IT HAS
BEEN ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING IT CAN BE FILED IN THE SYSTEM FOLDER
FOR COMPLETED REQUESTS.

        IF POSTAGE OR TRANSPORTATION CHARGES ARE DUE, TWO COPIES
OF THE REQUEST ARE MADE AND CLIPPED TO THE JOB.  THE ORIGINAL
REQUEST AND THE JOB HARDCOPY ARE FILED.  WHEN THE JOB IS MAILED,
A COPY OF THE REQUEST SHOULD BE SENT WITH THE JOB AND THE OTHER
COPY IS MARKED WITH THE CHARGES AND PLACED IN THE APPROPRIATE
FOLDER.

        WHEN THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER, PICKS UP THESE
COPIES, THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATOR OF THE PARTICULAR
SYSTEM INVOLVED, SO THAT POSTAGE CAN BE ENTERED USING THE 'POST-
AGE' COMMAND.  THE MINIMUM CHARGE ALLOWED IS $00.13.  AFTER
BCHARGE IS RUN, THE TTY OUTPUTS SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO THE
REQUEST AND RETURNED TO BATCH CONTROL.

        IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LEAD OPERATORS OR BATCH 
CONTROLLERS, TO ENSURE THAT ALL BATCH REQUESTS ARE PROPERLY
ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING.

        THE SPOOL PROGRAM PRINTS OUT A HARDCOPY TO THE SUPCHECK TTY,
ALLOWING THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER TO QUEUE REQUESTS BY
PAPER TYPE.  IN THIS WAY, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MINIMIZE SET-UP
TIME BY PRINTING ALL REQUESTS OF A CERTAIN PAPER TYPE AT ONE SESSION
USING THE 'TAPE' COMMAND FOR FILES FROM ANOTHER SYSTEM.  THE LEAD
OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER SHOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ALL RELEVENT
SPOOL INFORMATION BEFORE PRINTING IS STARTED FOR CASES WHERE SPECIAL
DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD BE USED FOR ASSIGNING PRIORITY (I. E.
AIR MAIL, SPECIAL DELIVERY JOBS MIGHT BE DONE IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN
HELD FOR OTHER SPOOL REQUESTS OF THE SAME PAPER TYPE).

        THE SPOOL REQUESTS SHOULD BE ANALYZED, LOGGED IN AND THEN
GIVEN TO THE SYSTEM OPERATOR TO BE PRINTED.  AFTER THE PRINTING IS
COMPLETED, A COPY OF THE REQUEST WILL BE PRINTED OUT TO THE OPERATOR'S
TTY.  AT THE END OF THE REQUEST THERE WILL BE A STATEMENT INDICATING
WHETHER OR NOT THE REQUEST SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING.

        UPON COMPLETION OF A SPOOL JOB, THE SPOOL REQUEST IS
INITIALED BY THE OPERATOR AND RETURNED TO BATCH CONTROL AREA
WITH THE JOB.

        AFTER IT IS CHECKED FOR ACCURACY, QUALITY OF PRINT, AND
COMPLETENESS, IT WILL BE PLACED IN THE MAIL ROOM ON THE SHELF
DESIGNATED FOR MAILING.

        EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ARE THOSE JOBS THAT NEED IMMEDIATE ATTEN-
TION.  THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER SHOULD PERFORM THE TASK OF
GETTING THE REQUEST READY FOR PICKUP AND DELIVERY; COMPLETING THE
NECESSARY PAPERWORK, AND CALLING THE DELIVERY COMPANY.  THE HARDCOPY
SHOULD THEN BE FILED.

        WHEN THE MAILING OF SPOOL REQUESTS HAS BEEN COMPLETED, A
COPY SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE FOLDER DESIGNATED FOR PICKUP.  THE
OPERATOR SHOULD RUN BCHARGE USING THE COMMAND 'CHARGE' TO ENTER IT
INTO ACCOUNTING, OR THE COMMAND 'POSTAGE' IF THE REQUEST HAS BEEN
ENTERED AND IS AWAITING 'DELIVERY' CHARGES.  THE TTY OUTPUT SHOULD
BE ATTACHED TO THE REQUEST AND RETURNED TO BATCH CONTROL.

INTRODUCTION
------------

        THE BCHARGE PROGRAM IS USED TO ENTER BATCH REQUEST (ALSO
CALLED PPR'S - PERIPHERAL PROCESSING REQUESTS) INTO THE ACCOUNTING
SYSTEM.  THE PROGRAM USES INFORMATION IN THE FILE (*1BATCH)
PARCHG.DAT WHICH IS UPDATED WHEN A CUSTOMER ENTERS A BATCH OR SPOOL
REQUEST.
        
VALID COMMANDS
--------------
        
        COMMANDS MAY BE SHORTENED TO THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS

FERENTLY), ARE ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING WHETHER OR NOT POSTAGE OR
TRANSPORTATION CHARGES ARE DUE.  HOWEVER, ON THE LAST DAY OF THE
MONTH BATCH ACCOUNTING MAY BE DEFERRED IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN
POSTAGE CHARGES.

        THERE ARE SEVEN JOB TYPES THAT OPERATORS CAN PERFORM VIA A PPR.

        TYPE 1: LISTINGS; SPOOL SHOULD BE USED FOR LISTINGS INSTEAD
OF BATCH REQUESTS; IF A BATCH REQUEST IS USED THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ON
THE REQUEST PERTAIN:

       *1-----PAGES-----PARTS TO LISTING-----LISTING DECOLLATED

       JOB TYPE 2 AND 3: CARD WORK; READING WITH PIP; PUNCHING
ON 940'S.
       *2-----CARDS TO DISC    *3-----DISC TO CARDS

       TYPE 4: RESTORES; TITO, FAILSA, 1STORE, MAGCON, VARREC,
OR VARIAN.
       *4-----FILES TAPE TO DISC

       TYPE 5: STORES; TITO, 1STORE, MAGCON, VARIAN AND VARREC;
USER MAY NEED TO BUY A TAPE FOR $40.00.
       *5-----FILES TO DISC TO TAPE-----TAPE CHARGE

       TYPE 6: MAGNETIC TAPE CONVERSIONS; MAGCON, VARREC AND
VARIAN; CHARGE IS $30.00 PER JOB.
       6-----OTHER CHARGE      *7-----TAPE CONVERSION

        TYPE 7: EUROPEAN STORES OR RESTORES; THESE CAUSE A CURRENCY
CONVERSION AND OTHER ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES WITH BCHARGE.
       *8-----EUROPEAN BATCH

(*= JOB TYPES)


        AFTER A BATCH REQUEST HAS BEEN COMPLETED THE OPERATOR
SIGNS AND DATES THE REQUEST. NEXT THE BCHARGE PROGRAM SHOULD BE
RUN. THIS PROGRAM ACCEPTS INPUTS CONCERNING THE  WORK THAT WAS JUST
COMPLETED AND IS INDEXED BY THE PPR (PERIPHERAL PROCESSING REQUEST)
NUMBER. THE FILE (*1BATCH)PARCHG.DAT IS SEARCHED FOR THE REQUEST 
NUMBER AND, ONCE THE BCHARGE RUN HAS BEEN COMPLETED, THE FINISHED
ACCOUNTING INFORMATION IS OUTPUT TO (*1BATCH)BATONN.MON WHERE
NN IS THE SYSTEM NUMBER AND MON IS THE ABBREVIATED MONTH.


        IF THE REQUEST HAS NOT BEEN ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING, IT
SHOULD BE 'QA'D' BY THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER AND THEN
FILED IN THE SYSTEM FOLDER FOR 'BCHARGE DUE' REQUESTS.  IF IT
HAS BEEN ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING IT CAN BE FILED IN THE SYSTEM
FOLDER FOR COMPLETED REQUESTS.

        IF POSTAGE OR TRANSPORTATION CHARGES ARE DUE, TWO COPIES
OF THE REQUEST ARE MADE AND CLIPPED TO THE JOB.  THE ORIGINAL
REQUEST AND THE JOB HARDCOPY ARE FILED.  WHEN THE JOB IS MAILED,
A COPY OF THE REQUEST SHOULD BE SENT WITH THE JOB AND THE OTHER
COPY IS MARKED WITH THE CHARGES AND PLACED IN THE APPROPRIATE
FOLDER.

        WHEN THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER, PICKS UP
THESE COPIES, THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATOR OF THE
PARTICULAR SYSTEM INVOLVED, SO THAT POSTAGE CAN BE ENTERED USING
THE 'POSTAGE' COMMAND.  THE MINIMUM CHARGE ALLOWED IS $00.13.
AFTER BCHARGE IS RUN, THE TTY OUTPUTS SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO THE
REQUEST AND RETURNED TO BATCH CONTROL.

        IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LEAD OPERATORS OR BATCH
CONTROLLERS, TO ENSURE THAT ALL BATCH REQUESTS ARE PROPERLY
ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING.


                        ACCOUNTING FOR SPOOL REQUESTS
                        -----------------------------

        THE SPOOL PROGRAM PRINTS OUT A HARDCOPY TO THE SUPCHECK TTY,
ALLOWING THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER TO QUEUE REQUESTS BY
PAPER TYPE.  IN THIS WAY, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MINIMIZE SET-UP
TIME BY PRINTING ALL REQUESTS OF A CERTAIN PAPER TYPE AT ONE SESSION
USING THE 'TAPE' COMMAND FOR FILES FROM ANOTHER SYSTEM.  THE
LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER SHOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ALL 
RELEVENT SPOOL INFORMATION BEFORE PRINTING IS STARTED FOR CASES
WHERE SPECIAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD BE USED FOR ASSIGNING
PRIORITY (I. E. AIR MAIL, SPECIAL DELIVERY JOBS MIGHT BE DONE
IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN HELD FOR OTHER SPOOL REQUESTS OF THE SAME
PAPER TYPE).

        THE SPOOL REQUESTS SHOULD BE ANALYZED, LOGGED IN AND THEN
GIVEN TO THE SYSTEM OPERATOR TO BE PRINTED.  AFTER THE PRINTING IS
COMPLETED, A COPY OF THE REQUEST WILL BE PRINTED OUT TO THE OPERATOR'S
TTY.  AT THE END OF THE REQUEST THERE WILL BE A STATEMENT INDICATING
WHETHER OR NOT THE REQUEST SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO ACCOUNTING.

        THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS DESCRIBE WHAT THE SPOOL PROGRAM
DOES AND WHAT STEPS THE OPERATOR TAKES TO ENTER IT INTO ACCOUNTING.

        THE SPOOL PROGRAM WILL PLACE RECORDS IN THE UNPROCESSED BATCH
RECORD FILES UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:

        A.  WHEN THE MODE OF DELIVERY IS OTHER THAN PICKUP.

        B.  WHEN THE SPOOL PROGRAM WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE
            PROCESSED BATCH RECORD FILE WITH A COMPLETED
            RECORD.

        C.  WHEN THE SPOOL PROGRAM WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE
            BATCH CHARGE RATE FILE.

        WHENEVER THE 'CHARGE' COMMAND IS CALLED, BCHARGE WILL SCAN
THE UNPROCESSED BATCH RECORD FILE FOR ANY SPOOLING RECORDS FALLING
UNDER CATEGORY B AND WILL MOVE THEM TO THE PROCESSED BATCH RECORD
FILE.

        RECORDS FALLING UNDER CATEGORY A AND C WILL REMAIN IN THE
UNPROCESSED BATCH RECORD FILE IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMENT
"SPOOL RECORD AWAITING POSTAGE CHARGES" UNTIL THE OPERATOR
RUNS THE CHARGE COMMAND AGAINST THAT RECORD.  THE OPERATOR
WILL ONLY BE PRESENTED WITH THE QUESTION "ENTER POSTAGE OR
TRANSPORTATION CHARGES" WHEN CHARGING A SPOOLING RECORD.

        UPON CAREFUL COMPLETION OF A SPOOL JOB, THE SPOOL REQUEST
HARDCOPY IS INITIALED BY THE OPERATOR AND RETURNED TO BATCH CONTROL
AREA WITH THE JOB.

        AFTER IT IS CHECKED FOR ACCURACY, QUALITY OF PRINT, AND
COMPLETENESS, IT WILL BE PLACED IN THE MAIL ROOM ON THE SHELF
DESIGNATED FOR MAILING.

        EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ARE THOSE JOBS THAT NEED IMMEDIATE ATTEN-
TION.  THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER SHOULD PERFORM THE TASK OF
GETTING THE REQUEST READY FOR PICKUP AND DELIVERY, COMPLETING THE
NECESSARY PAPERWORK, AND CALLING THE DELIVERY COMPANY.  THE HARDCOPY
SHOULD THEN BE FILED.

        WHEN THE MAILING OF SPOOL REQUESTS HAS BEEN COMPLETED,
A COPY SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE FOLDER DESIGNATED FOR PICKUP.  THE
OPERATOR SHOULD RUN BCHARGE USING THE COMMAND 'CHARGE' TO ENTER IT
INTO ACCOUNTING, OR THE COMMAND 'POSTAGE' IF THE REQUEST HAS BEEN
ENTERED AND IS AWAITING 'DELIVERY' CHARGES.  THE TTY OUTPUT SHOULD
BE ATTACHED TO THE REQUEST AND RETURNED TO BATCH CONTROL.

                               -----------------------


INTRODUCTION:

       1POS WAS DESIGNED TO OUTPUT INFORMATION CONCERNIN TAPE POSITION AND
AND THE CONTENTS OF THAT POSITION. A TYPICAL USE IS TO DETERMINE THE LAST GOOD
POSITION ON A TAPE PROGRAM THAT HAS ABORTED IN THE MIDDLE OF A JOB.
THE PROGRAM WILL READ HEADER INFORMATION WRITTEN IN 1STORE
TYMSHARE FORMAT AND OUTPUT THIS INFORMATION TO A TERMINAL.
THIS PROGRAM CAN PROCESS BOTH FIXED LENGTH AND VARIABLE LENGTH
"UAD" FORMAT TAPES PLUS THE "SUPERVISOR" FORMAT TAPES AND TAPE
WRITTEN ON THE TYMCOM-X'S IN "STORE" FORMAT.


INSTRUCTIONS:

       THE PROGRAM ONLY READS TAPES ON TAPE UNIT O.
IF UNIT O IS FOUND TO BE READY, THE PROGRAM WILL WAIT FOR IT
TO COME INTO READY.

       THE PROGRAM CHECKS FOR OPERATOR STATUS BEFORE TRYING TO EXECUTE.
THE PROGRAM ASSUMES THE OPERATOR KNOWS WHAT SYSTEM HE IS LOGGED
INTO.

       IF THE TAPE DRIVES ARE ASSIGNED, THE PROGRAM ASSUMES THE OPERATOR
KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING AND THEY ARE RELEASED AND REASSIGNED.
IF THE PRINTER IS ASSIGNED, THE MESSAGE "PRINTER ASSIGNED
RELEASE?" WILL BE PRINTED ON THE TERMINAL.  IF THE FIRST CHARACTER
INPUT IS A "Y", THEN THE PROGRAM WILL RELEASE THE PRINTER AND
CONTINUE.  ANY OTHER RESPONE WILL TERMINATE THE PROGRAM.

       THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS OUTPUT WHEN 1POS IS RUN.

       IF THE TAPE IS WRITTEN IN "UAD" FORMAT, THE MESSAGE "**UAD
FORMAT**" WILL BE FOLLOWED BY:

     TAPE POSITION,
     SYSTEM NUMBER,
     MONTH AND DAY THE FILE WAS WRITTEN ON TAPE,
     THE FILE DIRECTORY NUMBER,
     THE FILE NAME.

       IF THE TAPE IS WRITTEN IN "SUPERVISOR" FORMAT THE FOLLOWING WILL
BE REQUESTED:

     TAPE POSITION,
     SYSTEM NUMBER,
     MONTH AND DAY FILE WRITTEN ON TAPE,
     THE USER NAME,
     THE FILE SIZE IN D-BITS,
     THE FILE NAME.

       IF A TAPE WRITTEN ON THE TYMCOM-X'S IS ENCOUNTERED, THE MESSAGE
"**TYMCOM X TAPE**" IS PRINTED ON THE TERMINAL, THE SAME INFOR-
MATION IS OUTPUT AS A "SUPERVISOR" TAPE EXCEPT THE FILE DIRECTORY
NUMBER IS O.

       IF AN END OF TAPE RECORD IS FOUND, THE MESSAGE "END OF TAPE
RECORD" IS PRINTED ON THE TERMINAL.  IF THE PROGRAM IS RUN AGAIN,
IT WILL BACKSPACE TO THE LAST FILE ON TAPE.  IF THE TAPE WAS
WRITTEN ON A TYMCOM-X THEN THE PROGRAM WILL NOT SPACE BACK PAST
THE END OF TAPE RECORD.

       EACH TIME THE PROGRAM IS RUN, IT WILL BACKSPACE ONE FILE.

       THE PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO READ A TAPE 10 TIMES.  IF IT FAILS ALL
10 TIMES, THE MESSAGE "TEN TAPE READ ERRORS ABORT" WILL PRINT ON
THE TERMINAL.

                  SYSTEM PRINTER OPERATION

     IN  THIS  DISCUSSION,  OPERATORS  HAVE  TWO  DIVISIONS,
SYSTEM  AND  REMOTE.   REMOTE OPERATORS ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO
HAVE REMOTE PRINT LICENSE WHICH IS SET BY THE DS PASSWORD ON
THE  TYMCOM-IX  AND  BY SETOP IN THE USER'S PASSWORD FILE ON
THE  TYMCOM-X.   SYSTEM  OPERATORS  ARE  DEFINED  AS  HAVING
OPERATOR  LICENSE AND BEING IN DISTRICT 0.  SYSTEM OPERATORS
MAY ALSO BE REMOTE OPERATORS, BUT NOT CONVERSELY.  THE  TERM
"OPERATORS"  IS  USED  TO ENCOMPASS BOTH TYPES OF OPERATORS.
ALL THE FOL LOWING COMMANDS  MAY  BE  EXECUTED  BY  OPERATORS
UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE.

                      STATUS COMMANDS

     THE STATUS COMMANDS (STATUS, REPORT, AND LIST)  MAY  BE
EXECUTED  BY  OPERATORS.   USE  OF  THE  STATUS  AND  REPORT
COMMANDS BY SYSTEM  OPERATORS  IS  SLIGHTLY  DIFFERENT  FROM
OTHER  USERS.  WHEREAS FOR ALL OTHER USERS A CARRIAGE RETURN
AFTER THE COMMAND DEFAULTS TO THE ALL  SUBCOMMAND,  FOR  THE
OPERATOR,  THE DEFAULT IS THE CENTER SUBCOMMAND.  THIS IS SO
THE OPERATOR NEED NOT BE BOTHERED BY REMOTE REQUESTS  UNLESS
HE  IS  INTERESTED IN THEM.  SHOULD THE OPERATOR USE THE ALL
OR REMOTE SUBCOMMAND,  THE LOCATION OF THE REMOTE REQUESTS IS
GIVEN AS RNNN WHERE NNN IS THE PRINTER LOCATION NUMBER.

     SYSTEM OPERATORS  CAN  RECEIVE  INFORMATION  ABOUT  ANY
REQUEST IN THE SYSTEM.  REMOTE OPERATORS RECEIVE INFORMATION
ONLY FOR THEIR PRINTER  LOCATION  AND  THEIR  DISTRICT.   IN
ADDITION,  WHEN OPERATORS EXECUTE ONE OF THE ABOVE COMMANDS,
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED.  THREE ADDITIONAL STATUS
WORDS CAN APPEAR IN THE STATUS LINE.

  TAPE  THE REQUEST HAS BEEN PLACED ON TAPE FOR PRINTING ON
        OTHER SYSTEMS (SEE STORE COMMAND)
  HOLD  THE REQUEST HAS BEEN PLACED ON HOLD BY AN OPERATOR.
  TRAN  THE REQUEST IS IN A  TRANSFER STATE AND NEEDS TO BE
        TRANSFERRED BY THE OPERATOR TO A DIFFERENT
        PRINTING SITE.

     IF THERE  ARE  ANY  REQUESTS  TO  BE  TRANSFERRED,  THE
OPERATOR  WILL  BE REMINDED OF THIS FACT BEFORE EACH COMMAND
IS  PROCESSED  AND  UNTIL  ALL  THE   REQUESTS   HAVE   BEEN
TRANSFERRED.

     INFORMATION CONCERNING THE TYPE OF PAPER AND NUMBER  OF
PAGES  IS  ALSO  GIVEN  FOR  THE  STATUS,  REPORT  AND  LIST
COMMANDS.  THE NUMBER OF PAGES THAT THE OPERATOR SEES IS THE
LEAST  NUMBER OF PAGES REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE REQUEST, NOT
THE NUMBER OF PAGES THAT WILL BE CHARGED.


     ALSO, IF A REQUEST REQUIRES A FULL CHARACTER SET (UPPER
AND  LOWER)  PRINTER, IT WILL BE FLAGGED AS "FC".  THIS WILL
APPEAR AFTER THE TYPE OF PAPER REQUIRED FOR THE REQUEST.


     WHEN A REQUEST IS PRINTED, THE  ACCOUNTING  INFORMATION
IS  WRITTEN  TO  ONE OF TWO PLACES.  IF THERE IS NO DELIVERY
CHARGE, THE INFORMATION IS WRITTEN  DIRECTLY  TO  ACCOUNTING
AND  NO  FURTHER  ACTION IS REQUIRED.  IF THERE ARE DELIVERY
CHARGES THE INFORMATION IS HELD SO THAT THE OPERATOR MAY ADD
THE  CHARGE.   SYSTEM  OPERATORS  USE  THE  PROGRAM 1BCHARGE
(TYMCOM-IX) OR BCHARGE (TYMCOM-X) TO COMPLETE  THE  REQ UEST.
REMOTE  OPERATORS  USE  THE  PROGRAM 1RCHARGE (TMYCOM-IX) OR
RCHARGE (TYMCOM-X) TO COMPLETE THE REQUEST.


                       PRINT COMMAND

     THERE ARE FIVE OPTIONS FOR THIS COMMAND WHICH CAN  ONLY
BE USED BY OPERATORS.  THIS COMMAND DOES THE PRINTING OF THE
SPOOLED FILES ON THE PRINTER.  WHEN  THE  REQUEST  HAS  BEEN
COMPLETED,  A  HARDCOPY IS PRODUCED FOR THE REQUEST.  AT THE
ONSET OF THE FIRST PRINT COMMAND ISSUED, THE  OPERATOR  WILL
BE  ASKED IF HIS PRINTER HAS A FULL CHARACTER SET (UPPER AND
LOWER).  IF THE REPLY IS "NO", ONLY THOSE REQUEST S WHICH  DO
NOT SPECIFY THE FULLCH OPTION WHEN SPOOLING WILL BE PRINTED.
SHOULD ANY OF THOSE REQUESTS  HAVE  LOWER  CASE  CHARACTERS,
THEY  WILL  BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE BEFORE BEING PRINTED.
IF THE PRINTER DOES NOT HAVE A FULL CHARACTER SET,  REQUESTS
THAT  REQUIRE  IT  (VIA THE FULLCH OPTION) CAN BE PRINTED BY
THE  PRINT  (NUMBER)  COMMAND.   THOSE  REQUESTS   WILL   BE
CONVERTED  TO  UPPER  CASE  BEFORE BEING PRINTED.  THE PRINT
OPTIONS AVAILABLE ARE DETAILED BELOW.

PRINT [ALL]

     THIS COMMAND WILL SORT ALL PENDING REQUESTS  (PEND)  BY
TYPE  OF  FORM AND NUMBER OF PARTS BEFORE PRINTING.  IF ONLY
ONE TYPE OF FO RM IS NEEDED FOR PRINTING, THE  OPERATOR  WILL
BE  TOLD  TO  MOUNT  THAT  TYPE  OF  FORM  ON  THE  PRINTER.
OTHERWISE, IF SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF FORMS ARE NEEDED, A
SUMMARY  OF  THE  FORMS  IS PRINTED AND THE OPERATOR WILL BE
ASKED WHICH TYPE OF FORM HE WISHES TO PRINT.   ALL  REQUESTS
FOR  THE  FORM  SPECIFIED  WILL  BE  PRINTED AND THE PROCESS
REPEATED UNTIL ALL REQUESTS FOR ALL FORMS ARE COMPLETED.


PRINT FORM

     THIS COMMAND IS USED FOR PRINTING ALL PENDING  REQUESTS
FOR  ONE  TYPE OF FORM.  THE SYSTEM WILL PROMPT THE OPERATOR
FOR THE TYPE OF FORM DESIRED, TELL HIM HOW  MANY  PAGES  ARE
REQUIRED, AND THEN PRI NT ALL PENDING REQUESTS FOR THAT FORM.


PRINT (NUMBER)

     THIS WILL PRINT ONLY THE  REQUEST  SPECIFIED.   IF  THE
REQUEST  IS  ANYTHING  BUT  PEND OR HOLD, CONFIRMATION AS TO
WHETHER THE REQUEST IS TO BE REDONE  IS  REQUIRED.   IF  THE
PRINTER HAS BEEN FLAGGED AS NOT A FULL CHARACTER SET PRINTER
AND THE REQUEST REQUIRES IT, THE OPERATOR WILL BE  ASKED  IF
HE  WANTS TO PRINT IT.  IF SO, THE REQUEST WILL BE CONVERTED
TO UPPER CASE BEFORE  BEING  PRINTED.   THE  TYPE  OF  PAPER
REQUIRED   IS   THEN   TYPED   AND  THE  PROGRAM  WAITS  FOR
CONFIRMATION OF THE  FORMS ON THE PRINTER.   THE  REQUEST  IS
THEN PRINTED.

     THIS IS THE ONLY COMMAND WHICH WILL PRINT A JOB ON HOLD
STATUS.    IN   THE  EVENT  THAT  MULTIPLE  FORMS  PAPER  IS
UNAVAILABLE, THE REQUEST MAY BE REDONE MULTIPLE  TIMES,  AND
ONLY ONE CHARGE IS RECORDED IN THE ACCOUNTING.

     DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT  A  USER  MAY  SPECIFY  THE
WRONG  PRINT  SWITCHES  WHEN  HE  MAKES  A  SPOOL REQUEST, A
FEATURE HAS BEEN INCLUDED FOR THE OPERATOR TO  OVERRIDE  THE
USER'S PRINT SWITCHES.

     ON THE  PRINT  (NUMBER),  RESTART  (NUMBER)  AND  STORE
(NUMBER)  COMMANDS,  THE  OPERATOR  WILL  BE ASKED OPTIONS.
THIS IS EF FECTIVELY ASKING THE OPERATOR WHAT PRINT  SWITCHES
TO  USE ON THE REQUEST.  THE OPERATOR MAY SPECIFY THE USE OF
THE USER'S ORIGINAL SWITCHES BY A CARRIAGE RETURN, OR HE MAY
ENTER  SWITCHES  WHICH  WILL OVERRIDE ONLY THOSE SWITCHES HE
SPECIFIES.  SWITCHES AVAILABLE ARE:  HEAD,  NOHEAD,  SINGLE,
DOUBLE, FORTRAN (TYMCOM-X), NOFORTRAN (TYMCOM-X) AND LINES=.



PRINT (NUMBER) FILENAME

     THIS COMMAND IS USED TO PRINT AN INDIVIDUAL FILE  OF  A
REQUEST.   THE FILE IS PRINTED IN ITS ENTIRETY AND ONLY ONCE
REGARDLESS OF HOW  MANY  COPIES  THE  REQUESTER  WANTS.   NO
ACCOUNTING RECORD IS CREATED.


PRINT TAPE

     THIS COMMAND IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO SYSTEM OPERATORS.  IT
IS  USED  TO  PRINT  REQUESTS  THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON TAPE
USING THE STORE COMMAND.  ON THE  940'S  THE  TAPE  MUST  BE
MOUNTED  ON  UNIT  0  .  ON THE PDP-10'S THE LOGICAL UNIT IS
REQUESTED,  ALONG  WITH  THE  DENSITY.   THE   OPERATOR   IS
QUESTIONED  AS TO THE TYPE OF PAPER ON THE PRINTER AND IF IT
IS NOT AVAILABLE, ALL REQUESTS USING  THAT  TYPE  PAPER  ARE
SKIPPED.   OTHERWISE,  ALL  REQUESTS  FOR THIS TYPE OF PAPER
WILL BE DONE AND THE NEXT TYPE OF PAPER WILL  BE  REQUESTED.
THIS  PROCESS  CONTINUES UNTIL T HE END OF TAPE.  INFORMATION
CONCERNING THESE REQUESTS ARE TRANSMITTED BACK TO  THE  HOME
SYSTEM   VIA   PJ,   WITH  THE  RESULT  OF  A  DELAY  BEFORE
TRANSPORTATION CHARGES MAY BE ENTERED ON THE HOME SYSTEM.


     IN ADDITION, THE KEYWORD REMOTE MAY BE  INSERTED  AFTER
THE  WORD PRINT IN ALL THE PRINT COMMANDS EXCEPT PRINT TAPE.
THIS  ALLOWS  SYSTEM  OPERATORS  TO  PRINT  REMOTE   SPOOLED
REQUESTS  ON  REMOTE PRINTERS.  ANY OPERATOR ENTERED CHARGES
FOR REMOTE REQUESTS MUST BE ENTERED BY 1RCHARGE (RCHARGE).

                      RESTART COMMAND

     THE RESTART COMMAND IS USED TO RESTART A  REQUEST  THAT
HAS  BEEN  ONLY PARTIALLY COMPLETED.  THE SYSTEM WILL PROMPT
FOR THE  REQUEST NUMBER, FILE NAME, RESTART COPY  NUMBER  AND
RESTART  PAGE  NUMBER.  THE COPY NUMBER CAN BE OBTAINED FROM
THE LAST FILE TITLE PAGE  OF  THE  FILE  IN  QUESTION.   THE
RESTART PAGE NUMBER IS THE PHYSICAL PAGE TO RESTART PRINTING
ON.  PAGE NUMBERS ON THE LISTING CANNOT BE RELIED UPON AS  A
CORRECT  INDICATOR  AS A RESTART PRINTING POINT IN THE FILE.
A CARRIAGE RETURN INDICATES TO BEGIN PRINTING AT  THE  START
OF  THE  FILE.   WHEN  THE  FILE IS FOUND, SPOOL PROCEEDS TO
PRINT THAT FILE AND ALL SUCCEEDING FILES FOR THE REQUEST.

     RESTART TAPE IS USED TO DO THE  SAME  THING  FOR  FILES
STORED ON TAPE USING THE STO RE COMMAND, EXCEPT THAT WITH THE
RESTART TAPE COMMAND, ALL OTHER REQUESTS ON THE TAPE WILL BE
PROCESSED ALSO.


     AS WITH THE PRINT COMMANDS, THE KEYWORD REMOTE  MAY  BE
USED AFTER THE RESTART COMMAND, BUT MAY NOT BE USED WITH THE
RESTART TAPE.

                         HOLD COMMAND

     THIS IS A  UTILITY  COMMAND  WHICH  IS  USED  TO  PLACE
INDIVIDUAL  REQUESTS ON HOLD, SUCH AS WHEN THERE IS NO PAPER
FOR THE REQUEST.  ONCE A REQUEST IS ON HOLD STATUS, IT SHOWS
UP  AS PEND ON USER STATUS COMMANDS, BUT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN
THE ALL COMMANDS FOR STORE AND PRINT.   THE  ONLY  WAY  THAT
REQUESTS  MAY  BE  TAKEN OFF HOLD STATUS IS TO BE PRINTED OR
STORED BY THE OPERATOR  OR  CANCELED  BY  THE  USER  OR  THE
OPERATOR.

                        STORE COMMAND

     THIS COMMAND IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO SYSTEM OPERATORS.  IT
IS USED TO PRINT SPOOLED REQUESTS FOR A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT
HAVE AN OPERATIONAL PRINTER.   THE  SUBCOMMANDS  ARE  [ALL],
FORM,  AND  (NUMBER)  AND  HAVE  THE  SAME FUNCTION AS THEIR
COUNTERPARTS IN THE PRINT COMMAND.   STORE  ALL  PLACES  THE
REQUESTS ON TAPE IN A SORTED ORDER BY FORM.

     THE [ALL] AND FORM  COMMANDS  WILL  OPERATE  ON  CENTER
REQUESTS  ONLY,  WHILE  A  STORE  (NUMBER) WILL OPERATE ON A
CENTER OR REMOTE REQUEST.

     ON THE 940'S THE  TAPE  IS  MOUNTED  ON  UNIT  0.   THE
PDP-10'S  REQUEST  THE  LOGICAL  NAME   (MTA0, FTA0, ETC) AND
DENSITY FOR THE DRIVE.

                       CANCEL COMMAND

     SINCE USERS CAN ONLY CANCEL REQUESTS WHICH ARE  PENDING
OR  ON  HOLD,  IT  IS  NECESSARY  TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO CANCEL
REQUESTS WHICH ARE IN OTHER STATUS STATES.   THEREFORE,  THE
OPERATOR   CAN  CANCEL  ANYONE'S  REQUEST  REGARDLESS  OF  A
REQUEST'S STATUS.


                       DELETE COMMAND

     THIS COMMAND IS FOR DELETING A FILE FROM A REQUEST  AND
SHOULD  ONLY  BE  USED  WHEN  A FILE CANNOT BE PRINTED, I.E.
FILE IS BAD OR BINARY.

                      TRANSFER  COMMAND

     A REQUEST GOES INTO TRANSFER STATUS WHEN THE  REQUESTER
INDICATES  HE WANTS HIS REQUEST PRINTED AT A DIFFERENT SITE.
THIS COMMAND MUST BE USED AGAINST ANY REQUEST THAT HAS  TRAN
STATUS.   THE  TRANSFER COMMAND IS THE ONLY OPERATOR COMMAND
WHICH CAN BE USED AGAINST A REQUEST WHICH IS IN TRAN STATUS.
THE  TRANSFER  COMMAND  WILL  MOVE  THE  REQUEST TO THE SITE
DESIRED WITH THE OPERATOR'S ASSISTANCE.  WHEN  THE  OPERATOR
ISSUES  A  TRANSFER  COMMAND  AGAINST THE REQUEST, THE SPOOL
SYSTEM WILL TELL HIM THE LOCATION TO  TRANSFER  THE  REQUEST
TO.   THE  OPERATOR  WILL ENTER A NODE NUMBER AND AN ADDRESS
WILL  BE   TYPED  OUT   THAT   MUST   BE   CONFIRMED.    UPON
CONFIRMATION,  THE  REQUEST WILL NOW BELONG TO THE NEW SITE.
IN PLACE OF A NODE NUMBER, THE WORD "CENTER" MAY BE USED, IN
WHICH CASE, THE REQUEST WILL BE MOVED TO THE COMPUTER CENTER
FOR PRINTING.

LATEST UPDATE: 04-19-73



I. GENERAL:

DESCRIPTION:
------------

PRINTER IS A PRINT PACKAGE WHICH ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO OUTPUT
A HIGH SPEED LINE PRINTER LISTING OF A FILE OR FILES TO A NUMBER
OF OUTPUT DEVICES FROM DISC FILES OR MAGNETIC TAPE.





REQUIRED STATUS:
----------------

OPERATOR STATUS IS REQUIRED IF OUTPUTTING FILES TO THE 940 PRINTER
OR IF INPUTTING FROM MAGNETIC TAPE. ALL OTHER OPERATIONS DO NOT
REQUIRE STATUS.





OPERATION:
----------

TO CALL THE PROGRAM, IN THE EXEC TYPE:

-PRINTER    

THE PROGRAM WILL PROMPT WITH THE FOLLOWING:

LINES:
FILE:

CONTROL A IS ALLOWED FOR EDITING PURPOSES DURING RUNNING OF THIS PROGRAM.

AN ALTMODE WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM WILL RING A BELL, RELEASE THE
DEVICE TO WHICH THE FILE WAS BEING INPUT FROM OR OUTPUT TO, AND
RETURNS WITH THE FOLLOWING PROMPT:

ALTMODE
LINES:

A CONTROL SHIFT O WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM WILL RETURN TO THE EXEC WITHOUT
RELEASING THE DEVICE TO WHICH THE FILE IS BEING INPUT FROM OR OUTPUT TO, UNLESS AN ALTMODE
WAS PREVIOUSLY TYPED.

TO TERMINATE THE PROGRAM TYPE Q AS A RESPONSE TO THE "FILE:" OR
"LINES:" PROMPT; TYPE A CARRIAGE RETURN AFTER THE FILENAME OR
TAPE OPTION.

A CARRIAGE RETURN FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE LINE FEED WILL GIVE A DIRECTORY
OF THE TAPE MOUNTED ON UNIT ZERO WITH 39 LINE FORMAT TO THE 940 LINE PRINTER. IF
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TAPE, AS IN AN ALL FILES, THE PROGRAM, UPON COMPLETION OF THE FIRST TAPE
DIRECTORY WILL CHECK TO SEE IF UNIT ONE IS READY. IF SO A TAPE DIRECTORY WILL ALSO
BE MADE OF THIS TAPE, IF NOT THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE. UPON COMPLETION OF THIS SECOND
TAPE DIRECTORY THE PROGRAM WILL CHECK TO SEE IF A NEW TAPE HAS BEEN MOUNTED ON UNIT ZERO
AND THAT IT IS IN READY,IF SO THE PROGRAM WILL PRINT A TAPE DIRECTORY OF THIS TAPE.
IF NOT THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE. THIS OPTION WILL CONTINUE IN THIS MANNER UNTIL IT
FINDS THAT A TAPE DRIVE IS NOT IN READY OR THAT A NEW TAPE HAS NOT BEEN MOUNTED.





OPTIONS:
--------

LINES:  CAN BE ANSWERED WITH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:

         S   -FOR SMALL PAPER,8" HIGH X 11" WIDE, 39 LINES PER PAGE
         B   -FOR LARGE PAPER,11" HIGH X 14" WIDE, 54 LINES PER PAGE
         NN  -WHERE NN=NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE TO BE PRINTED

        IF THIS OPTION IS FOLLOWED BY A LINE FEED IT WILL, AFTER COMPLETING THE "FILE:"
        OPTIONS, RETURN WITH THE PROMPT "LINES:". IF THIS OPTION IS TERMINATED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN
        THE PROGRAM WILL EITHER TERMINATE AFTER "FILE" OPTIONS OR RETURN WITH THE PROMPT "FILE:".

FILE:  CAN BE ANSWERED WITH 8 BASIC OPTIONS;

           FILENAME
           ALL FILES
           TO
           USE
           FROM
           COPY
           START WITH
           START AT

THE LAST SIX  OPTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A SPACE AND A FURTHER COMMAND

THE FILENAME AND ALL FILES OPTIONS CAN BE TERMINATED WITH EITHER A CARRIAGE
RETURN OR A LINE FEED. THE LINE FEED WILL RETURN WITH THE PROMPT "FILE:" AFTER THE LAST FILE
PRINTED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING OPTION. THE CARRIAGE RETURN WILL RETURN TO THE EXEC
AFTER THE LAST FILE PRINTED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING OPTION.

ALL OPTIONS CAN BE COMBINED, HOWEVER IF MORE THAN ONE SUBOPTION IS USED FROM ONE OF THE 
BASIC OPTIONS, THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE LAST SUBOPTION TYPED.I.E.
IF YOU TYPE USE HEAD, AND AFTER THAT ENTERED "USE CHEAD" THE PROGRAM WOULD USE CHEAD.

       FILENAME  - WILL OUTPUT THE FILENAME GIVEN TO THE 940 LINE
                   PRINTER UNLESS ANOTHER OUTPUT DEVICE HAS BEEN
                   SPECIFIED.
       ALL FILES - WILL OUTPUT ALL SYMBOLIC FILES IN THE DIRECTORY
                   CURRENTLY IN USE (GFD OR LOGIN).

                               ------

 AUTOMATIC MACHINE USAGE COMMAND KEY


AMUCK

THE PROGRAM "AMUCK" NOW REPLACES THE OLD ISU PROGRAM.
ON ENTRY INTO AMUCK, A ":" NOTIFIES THE USER THAT HE(SHE)
IS AT THE COMMAND LEVEL. AT THE COMMAND LEVEL, THERE ARE
SEVERAL COMMANDS WHICH WILL INVOKE A NON-ERROR RESPONSE FROM
THE COMPUTER.

       1. HELP - LISTS ALL VALID COMMANDS.

       2. ENTER- ALLOWS ENTRY OF THE SYSTEM USAGE.
                 (THIS IS IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE OLD ISU AND WILL BE
                  EXPLAINED LATTER..)

       3. EDIT - ALLOWS RE-ENTRY OF THE SYSTEM USAGE.
          THIS INCLUDES CHANGING THE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION.
       NOTE: IF ONE WHISHES TO CHANGE THE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION,
             HE MUST RESPOND TO ALL ACCOUNTING INPUT QUESTIONS.
             A C.R. RESPONSE LEAVES THAT ITEM UNTOUCHED.

       4. ?    - SAME AS HELP.

       5. QUIT - QUIT THE PROGRAM BACK TO THE EXEC.
          NOTE: ALTMODES AND ESC'S. ARE TURNED OFF
                AND WILL BE TURNED ON , ONLY AFTER EXECUTING
                THE QUIT COMMAND.
                IF YOU EXPERIENCE AN INSTRUCTION TRAP, OR ARE HUNG
                FOR SOME REASON, RE-EXECUTE "AMUCK" AND QUIT - IN
                ORDER TO RESTORE ESC'S.

          NOTE: A "QUIT" MAY BE TYPED DURYING THE ENTRY OF A DATE,
                OR DURYING THE ENTRY OF A CODE. THIS WILL PUT
                THE USER BACK TO THE COMMAND LEVEL.

       SOME OF THE TYPICAL QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED :

       DATE ? MM-DD-YY
       SPLIT SCHEDULE ? (Y OR N) Y
       INPUT SCHEDULED TYMSHARING HOURS ?0-1800  (MINUTES FROM MIDNIGHT)

       CODE,STOP TIME ? 10,0200  (CODE 10 = TYMSHARING, STOPPED AT 0200)
       CODE,STOP TIME ? 36,0300  ( CODE 36= LOST TIME TYMNET
                                   STOPPED AT 0300. THEREFORE 1 HR.
                                   WAS LOST TO TYMNET.)




























                               MURK
                               ----

  THE PROGRAM "MURK" REPLACES THE OLD MUR PROGRAM.
NOTE: DO NOT USE THE OLD MUR TO GENERATE REPORTS; IT BY ITSELF,
WILL PRODUCE INVALID AND INCORRECT REPORTS.

MURK WILL LINK WITH RETRIEVE AND DO ALL THE GOOD THINGS
REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A REPORT. ONLY ONE RESPONSE IS REQUIRED FROM
THE OPERATOR; INPUT, OF THE DATE OF REPORT.
THE FILE CALLED "CN", WHERE N=SYS. NO., IS THE PRINTER FILE.
( IN THE CASE OF HOUSTON, "C" IS REPLACED WITH "H").



























                               LURK
                               ----

THE PROGRAM "LURK" LISTS AN ARRAY OF DAYS, WHERE EACH ELEMENT OF THE
ARRAY REPRESENTS ONE DAY OF THE MONTH. AN ELEMENT MAY BE ZERO,
OR CONTAIN AN INTEGER VALUE ( FOR TYMSHARE 940'S ONLY ).
IF AN INTEGER VALUE IS PRESENT, AMUCK WAS RUN ON THE DAY REPRESENTED
BY THE INTEGER VVALUE (MMDD). A ZERO INDICATES THAT THE
ACCOUNTING HAS BEEN RUN BUT AMUCK HAS NOT, FOR THAT PARTICULAR DAY 
OF THE MONTH, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ELEMENTS POSITION IN THE ARRAY.

NOTE: THIS ELEMENT IS UPDATED, AFTER EITHER OF TWO EVENTS
      OCCURE; I.E. ENTER OR EDIT, FOR A PARTICULAR
      DAY OF THE MONTH.

























                               OPER PASSWORD SYSTEM
                               --------------------

        OPERATOR'S PASSWORDS ARE KEPT UNDER USER NUMBER 1 IN SYMBOLIC FILE NAMED PSWD.
        THE FORMAT OF THE FILE PSWD IS:

              . LINE 1 MAY CONTAIN ANY COMMENT OR INDENTIFICATION AND IS IGNORED.

              . LINE 2 CONTAINS THE FIRST OPERATOR OR MANAGER NAME.

              . LINE 3 CONTAINS THREE OCTAL WORDS OF DATA FOR THE OPERATOR OR MANAGER NAME.

              . LINE 4 CONTAINS THE SECOND OPERATOR OR MANAGER NAME.

        AND SO ON.

        THE OPERATOR OR MANAGER NAME CAN CONTAIN ANY CHARACTER EXCEPT A CARRIAGE RETURN.

        THE THREE DATA WORDS FOLLOWING EACH NAME CONTAIN INFORMATION APPLYING TO THAT OPERATOR OR MANAGER.
        THE FIRST OCTAL NUMBER IS DIVIDED INTO THREE FIELDS AS FOLLOWS:

        AAABBCCC

              . FIELD AAA CONTAINS THE CONTROLS THAT ARE MERGED INTO THE 
              OPERATOR'S CONTROL PARAMETER WORD. AT PRESENT ONLY THE OPERATOR
              BIT (100BBCCC) AND THE SYSTEM STATUS BIT (001BBCCC) HAVE ANY SINGIFICANCE.
              THE FORMER IS USED BY THE EXECUTIVE TO VALIDATE AN OPERATOR AND THE
              LATTER TO VALIDATE SUBSYSTEM STATUS.

              . FIELD BB IS USED FOR PROGRAM CONTROL. ONLY THE FIRST AND LAST BITS
              OF THIS FIELD ARE CURRENTLY IN USE. SETTING THE FIRST BIT (AAA40CCC)
              ALLOWS AN OPERATOR OR MANAGER TO CHANGE HIS PASSWORD WITH THE OPPS
              PROGRAM DESCRIBED BELOW. SETTING THE LAST BIT (AAA01CCC) DEFIINES
              THE USER AS A MANAGER. THIS BIT IS NOT PROPAGATED TO THE OPERATOR'S
              DATA WHEN THE MANAGER ADDS A NEW OPERATOR NAME TO HIS SECTION.

              . FIELD CCC CONTAINS THE DISTRICT NUMBER.
              THE SECOND AND THIRD DATA WORDS CONTAINS THE OPERATOR'S OR MANAGER'S PASSWORD.

        NOTE: THE FILE PSWD IS ESTABLISHED BY SOFTWARE QUALITY CONTROL
             GROUP WHO ENTER THE OPERATIONS MANAGER'S NAME AND PARAMETER AND GIVE
             THE FILE THE NECESSARY STATUS.

        TO VALIDATE A MANAGER, SYSTEMS PEOPLE MUST ENTER THE MANAGER IN THE PASSWORD FILE AS FOLLOWS:

        IDENT (CR)
        KOVAK (CR)
        10041000 00000000 00000000 (CR)
(CR)
(CR)

        NOTE: WHERE (CR)= CARRIAGE RETURN

        THE SECOND TWO DATA WORDS WILL CONTAIN THE PASSWORD AFTER KOVAK EXECUTES
        THE OPPS PROGRAM DESCRIBED BELOW.

                    PASSWORD PROGRAMS

              THE OPERATIONS MANAGER CAN USE OPPS TO VALIDATE OR CHANGE HIS
        PASSWORD. SETOP ALLOWS THE OPERATIONS MANAGER TO PUT A NEW OPERATOR
        IN THE PASSWORD FILE OR TO CHANGE OR INVALIDATE AN OPERATOR'S NAME.

              THE OPERATIONS MANAGER CALLS 1OPPS TO VALIDATE HIS OWN PASSWORD AS FOLLOWS:

        -1OPPS (CR)
        PROGRAM RESPONDS WITH: ENTER YOUR NAME: MIKE (CR)
                                                 -----
PROGRAM RESPONDS WITH: ENTER NEW PASSWORD: (TYPE PASSWORD, NO ECHO) (CR)

              THE OPERATIONS MANAGER MAY NOW VALIDATE THE OPERATOR'S NAME IN THE 
              PASSWORD FILE BY CALLING 1SETOP AS FOLLOWS:

        -1SETOP (CR)
        PROGRAM RESPONDS WITH: ENTER YOUR NAME. TYPE NAME
        -(TYPE YOUR PASSWORD, NO ECHO) (CR)
        PROGRAM RESPONDS: ENTER OPERATORS NAME: TYPE OPERATORS NAME
        THE PROGRAM WILL RESPOND WITH: NEW NAME ENTERED
        IF THE MANAGER DOES NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL NAMES TO ENTER HE COULD ALTMODE
        OUT OF THE PROGRAM.


              THE OPERATOR OR OPERATORS ARE NOW VALIDATED  AND  CAN NOW ENTER
              THERE OWN PASSWORD BY CALLING 1OPPS AS OUTLINE ABOVE.

              IF THE OPERATOR(S) WISHES TO  CHANGE HIS PASSWORD, HE CALLS 1OPPS AS FOLLOWS:

        1OPPS (CALLING THE PROGRAM)
        PROGRAM RESPONDS WITH: ENTER YOUR NAME.
        THE PROGRAM WILL ASK THAT YOU ENTER YOUR PASSWORD (NO ECHO)
        ENTER NEW PASSWORD: (NO ECHO)


              TO CHANGE AN OPERATOR(S) NAME THE MANAGER CALLS THE 1SETOP
              PROGRAM (SAME AS ABOVE EXCEPT THAT THE PROGRAM WILL ASK THAT YOU 
              TYPE IN THE ONAME, THE PROGRAM WILL RESPOND WITH OLD NAME
              AND THEN WILL ASK THAT YOU TYPE IN THE NEW NAME)


              CAUTION: IF AN OPERATIONS MANAGER ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE HIS OWN NAME,
              HIS STATUS AS AN OPERATIONS MANAGER IN THE PASSWORD FILE WILL BE LOST.

              HE SHOULD CONTACT SOFTWARE QUALITY CONTROL IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE THE OPERATIONS
              MANAGER'S NAME.

              THE PASSWORD FILE MAY BE COPIED BY ADDRESSING IT AS ()PSWD.
              HOWEVER, ANY ATTEMPT TO CHANGE IT EXCEPT AS OUTLINE ABOVE WILL
              RESULT IN ITS LOSS OF STATUS AND INVALIDATION.

        NOTE: TO SET OPERATOR STATUS, PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:

        -DS (CR)
        TYPE IN YOUR NAME
        - TYPE IN YOUR PASSWORD (NO ECHO)

PURPOSE: CHANGES PASSWORD FOR ACCOUNT YOU ARE LOGGED INTO ONLY.
         MUST HAVE MIN. OF ACCOUNT SUP. STATUS TO RUN.

PROCEDURE: AT EXEC LEVEL THE OPERATOR TYPES
         1) PASSWORD (CR)
         2) THE SYSTEM WILL RESPOND WITH 
            TYPE PASSWORD
            -------------
            THE OPERATOR WILL TYPE  THE NEW PASSWORD FOR SELECTED 
            ACCOUNT. *NOTE THIS PROCEDURE SHOULD ONLY BE USED
            FOR IN-HOUSE ACCOUNTS AND ONLY WITH THE AUTHORIZE
            PERMISSION OF THE DEPTMENT HEAD. THE PASSWORD WILL NOT
            ECHO BACK.
          3) THE SYSTEM WILL AGAIN RESPOND WITH
            TYPE IT AGAIN
           ---------------
           THE OPERATOR WILL AGAIN RETYPE THE PASSWORD. (THIS IS
           A CHECK)
           IF THE TWO PASSWORDS JUST TYPED DO NOT AGREE.
           THE RESPONDS ERROR,TYPE PASSWORD WILL OCCUR.
           THE OPERATOR WILL AGAIN RE-ENTER THE PASSWORD.

           IF THE TWO PASSWORDS DO AGREE THE  RESPONDS WILL BE
           NEW PASSWORD NOW ENTERED.

                        TYCOM-IX BRINGUP
                        ----------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

        THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROCEDURE IS TO BRING THE HOST COMPUTER
SYSTEM UP FOR NORMAL OPERATION (CODE 10: TIMESHARING) AFTER THE SYSTEM
HAS BEEN OFF THE AIR DUE TO A CRASH, POWER FAILURE OR NORMAL TAKEDOWN
PROCEDURES.

        IF A SYSTEM HAS CRASHED OR IF THERE HAS BEEN A POWER FAILURE,
STANDARD PROCEDURES ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ARE DOCUMENTED ELSEWHERE IN 
THIS MANUAL.  THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES ASSUME THAT EVERYTHING NECESSARY
HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND THE SYSTEM IS READY TO BE BROUGHT UP.  THE
'RUN-IDLE' SWITCH ON THE 940 CONSOLE SHOULD BE IN 'IDLE' POSITION AND
THE 'START' BUTTON SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUSHED.  THERE SHOULD BE NO LIGHTS
LIT ON THE 940 CONSOLE AT THIS TIME.

OPERATION AND SAMPLE OUTPUT
---------------------------

        THE OPERATOR SHOULD INITIAL EACH STEP IN THE SYSTEM LOGBOOK
AS IT IS COMPLETED.

        PUT THE TERMINAL IN 'SELECTOR CHANNEL' MODE AND THEN TYPE
'UP;G' ON THE TTY.  IF ALL IS OKAY WITH THE SELECTOR CHANNEL YOU 
WILL BE ASKED THE QUESTION 'HOST'.  TYPE IN THE HOST SYSTEM YOU ARE
BRINGING UP.  NEXT YOU WILL BE ASKED 'LOC' WHICH IS IN REFERENCE
TO THE DISCMAP LOCATION OF THE MONITOR (2 FOR THE CURRENT MONITOR AND
4 FOR ANOTHER COPY OF THE CURRENT MONITOR.  IF NEITHER OF THESE MONI-
TORS WILL COME UP SUCCESSFULLY, OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM SHIFT MANAGER
BEFORE TRYING A BRINGUP FROM LOCATION 12 - (BACKUP (OLD) MONITOR).
BE SURE TO CHECK THE '1DISCMAP' POSTED ON THE CONSOLE OF EACH
COMPUTER.

       IF ALL HAS GONE WELL TO THIS POINT, THE MESSAGE 'HOST LOADED'
IS OUTPUT AND A BELL WILL RING ON THE TERMINAL.  NOW YOU CAN RETURN
THE TERMINAL FUNCTION BOX TO THE 'REMOTE' (NETWORK) POSITION.  NEXT
PUSH THE 'START' BUTTON ON THE 940 CONSOLE, AND PUT THE 'RUN-IDLE'
SWITCH TO 'STEP-IDLE' AND THEN TO 'RUN'.  THE INTERRUPT LIGHT SHOULD
COME ON TO INDICATE THE TIMESHARING SYSTEM IS RUNNING.

        NOW LOG INTO THE SYSTEM UNDER THE USERNAME 'OPER'.  THE
SYSTEM WILL RESPOND WITH A BELL, OUTPUT THE WORD 'SHUT' AND RING THE
BELL AGAIN.  THE COMPUTER WILL THEN TYPE A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE
SYSTEM NUMBER AND THE LAST START UP TIME.  YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR
THE CURRENT DATE AND TIME OR ELSE THE HARDWARE ID NUMBER, DEPENDING
ON WHICH MONITOR IS RUNNING ON THAT SYSTEM.  THE OPERATOR SHOULD TYPE
THIS IN.  TIME IS BASED ON MILITARY TIME FORMAT AND A TWENTY-FOUR HOUR
CLOCK.  SET 'OPER' STATUS AND THEN TYPE '1SCANMAPS' TO DETERMINE IF
A BAD MAP ZONE EXISTS THAT '1REFRESH' CAN CORRECT.  AFTER '1SCANMAPS'
AND/OR '1REFRESH' HAS COMPLETED TYPE IN '1SETMAP'.  THE REMAINING
BRINGUP PROCEDURES WILL RUN AUTOMATICALLY FROM A COMMANDS FILE CALLED
'OPCOM'.

        AT THE COMPLETION OF THE BRINGUP PROCEDURES, THAT PART OF THE
TTY HARDCOPY, FROM 'LAST START UP' TO 'END OF STARTUP ROUTINES' IS
MARKED WITH THE SYSTEM NUMBER AND DATE.  THIS IS FILED IN
THE SYSTEM 'STARTUP' FOLDER FOR THAT DAY IN THE BATCH CONTROL AREA.
(EXAMPLE:  IF YOU STARTED THE SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES ON A SUNDAY, THE 
BRINGUP PROCEDURES ARE FILED IN SUNDAYS FOLDER).

(EVERY OPERATOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO BRING UP ANY SYSTEM MANUALLY WITHOUT
THE AID OF THE 'OPCOM' FILE AND SHOULD KNOW ALL THE COMMANDS IN IT).














SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------

(SET TTY FUNCTION TO SELECTOR CHANNEL)

(TYPE) UP;G                     (CARRIAGE RETURN IS AUTOMATIC)

        UP;G CAUSES THE DIM CODE TO ASK THE OPERATOR FOR THE HOST
        NUMBER AND THE MONITOR LOCATION.  THIS SAVES THE CRASH ON 
        LOCATIONS 0, 1, 20 AND 24 AND LOADS THE MONITOR INTO THE 940
        MEMORY.

        UP-1;G WORKS LIKE UP;G EXCEPT THAT IT INHIBITS THE CRASHSAVE.

'HOST NUMBER' 17 (CR)                   (HOST NUMBER AND LOCATION
'LOC.' 2 (CR)                            NUMBER ARE ENTERED BY
                                         OPERATOR)
'940 LOADED'

        (A NOTE ON HOST TELETYPES IN A DUAL-CHANNEL SYSTEM)

               (THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE APPLIES TO HOST 1 (TTY ON
                RIGHT OF 940 CONSOLE)

                MOVE TOGGLE SWITCH ON TERMINAL FUNCTION BOX FROM
                SELECTOR CHANNEL TO NETWORK.  NEXT, PUSH THE 'START'
                BUTTON AND MOVE TOGGLE SWITCH ON 940 CONSOLE TO 
                'STEP', 'IDLE-RUN' POSITION.  WAIT UNTIL LIGHTS
                FLASH ON THE 940 CONSOLE BEFORE LOGGING IN.  IF TTY
                DOES NOT RESPOND, PUSH THE DISCONNECT BUTTONS ON THE
                TERMINAL BOX SO YOU CAN LOG IN.  AFTER PRESSING THE
                BUTTONS, THE TTY MAY PRINT OUT SOME UNRECOGNIZABLE
                CHARACTERS.  PRESSING THE TERMINAL IDENTIFIER 'D'
                HALTS THIS AND PROMPTS YOU TO LOG IN)

               (THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE APPLIES TO HOST 0 (TTY ON
                LEFT OF 940 CONSOLE)

                THE PROCEDURE OUTLINED ABOVE APPLY HERE ALSO.
                EXCEPT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PRESS THE DISCONNECT
                BUTTONS ON THE TERMINAL BOX TO BE ABLE TO LOG IN.
                ON THIS TTY, YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROMPTED TO
                LOG IN)

ERRORS/RECOVERIES
-----------------

        ANY ERRORS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE BRINGUP PROCEDURES SHOULD
BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE LEAD OPERATOR/BATCH CONTROLLER OR
SHIFT MANAGER.

UP;G ERRORS
-----------

        IF THE HOST SPECIFIED IS ON NEITHER THE LOWER OR UPPER PACKS,
DIM TYPES BAD HOST NUMBER.  IF EITHER PACK 0 OR PACK 8 IS OFF LINE
AND THE HOST NUMBER IS INVALID, DIM TYPES 'IO ER'.  IF AN 'IO ERROR'
OCCURS IN LOADING THE MONITOR, DIM TYPES 'IO ER'.  IF THE OPERATOR 
DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HOSTS ARE ON HIS PACKS, HE MUST BRING UP A KNOWN
HOST BY USING THE '1OPER' DOCUMENT (PACK RECORDS), AND READ THE HOST
NUMBER OFF THE UNKNOWN PACKS.  THE 'UP' COMMAND MAY ALSO TYPE 'ER,
ALREADY UP' OR 'MIC ER'.  'UP' ONLY CHECKS FOR DISC READ ERRORS.
DISC WRITE ERRORS DO NOT ABORT THE 'UP' COMMAND.  IF 'IO ER' KEEPS
A 940 FROM COMING UP, THE 'HOST' IS DOWN UNTIL AN EXPERT DIAGNOSIS
THE PROBLEM.




















                        1SYSCHECK PROGRAM
                        -----------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

        1SYSCHECK IS DESIGNED TO BE RUN BY THE COMMAND FILE
'OPCOM' UPON SYSTEM BRINGUP, HOWEVER, IT MAY BE RUN AT ANY TIME
IF OPERATORS LICENSE HAS BEEN SET.

        IT VERIFYS THE CHECKSUM OF OPERATING SYSTEMS, DIM, BASE CODES,
AND UTILITY PROGRAMS FROM THE DISC DUMP AREAS AGAINST THE CHECKSUMS
RECORDED IN 1DISCMAP, AND REPORTS ANY DIFFERENCES.

        IN ADDITION, 1SYSCHECK CHECKS THE IPL (INITIAL PROGRAM LOAD)
AGAINST FILE (*6UTIL)IPLCKFILE WHICH IS CREATED WHEN THE IPL IS WRITTEN
TO THE DISC BY 1INSTALL.  IF THE IPL COMPARES AGAINST (*6UTIL)IPL-
CKFILE, THE MESSAGE 'IPL OKAY' IS DISPLAYED, OTHERWISE, THE MESSAGE
'IPL APPARENTLY BAD' IS DISPLAYED.

        IF THE FILE (*6UTIL)IPLCKFILE IS MISSING (AS WOULD BE THE CASE
UNTIL THE IPL IS NEXT WRITTEN THROUGH 1INSTALL) OR IF IT IS BAD AN
APPROPRIATE MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED AND THE IPL CHECK IS BYPASSED.

        IF A DIFFERENCE OCCURS A MESSAGE IS OUTPUT TO NOTIFY YOUR
SUPERVISOR AND A SERIES OF SLOW BELLS ARE RUNG AT THE TERMINAL.

OPERATION AND SAMPLE OUTPUT
---------------------------

        AFTER '1REFRESH' AND '1SETMAP', THE COMMAND FILE 'OPCOM' IS
AUTOMATICALLY RUN.  IT IS DURING 'OPCOM' AND AFTER THE '1WSD' RUN
THAT THE SYSTEM CHECKSUM PROGRAM WILL OCCUR.  IF AN OPERATOR WANTS
TO RUN IT AT ANY OTHER TIME, STATUS MUST BE SET AND '1SYSCHECK'
TYPED WHILE IN EXEC.

                        SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES
                        -------------------
INTRODUCTION
------------

        EACH TYCOM-IX HAS A SCHEDULE SHUTDOWN TIME: THE TIME WHEN
THE SCHEDULED TIMESHARING (CODE 10) FOR THE DAY CEASES.  THIS 
ESTABLISHES THE TIME WHEN THE SYSTEM WILL BE 'SHUT' (NEW LOGINS DIS-
ABLED).  AT SOME TIME AFTER THE SHUTDOWN TIME USERS MUST BE REMOVED
FROM THE SYSTEM SO THAT PART OF THE ACCOUNTING CAN BE RUN.  THEN THE
SYSTEM IS TAKEN DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE, PACKCOPY, ETC.  EVERY TYCOM-IX
MUST BE TAKEN DOWN DAILY.

OPERATION AND SAMPLE OUTPUT
---------------------------

        ONE AND ONE-HALF HOUR BEFORE THE SCHEDULED SHUTDOWN TIME THE
OPERATOR LOGS OUT OF THE USERNAME 'OPER1' AND INTO THE USERNAME
'BACKUP'.  THIS INSURES THAT ALL NEW FILES CREATED UNDER THE USERNAME
'OPER' WILL BE PICKED UP ON THE BACKUP.  UPON LOGGING INTO THE USER-
NAME 'BACKUP' AN INITIALIZED FILE WILL OUTPUT A SHUTDOWN ANNOUNCEMENT
LETTER TO ALL USERS WHO ARE LOGGED INTO THE SYSTEM.

        NEXT THE 'PSP' AND ERROR ENTRIES FOR THE DAY ARE OUTPUT.
IF THERE ARE ANY ERRORS, THEY SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM LOG-
BOOK AND BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF YOUR SUPERVISOR.  IF THE SYSTEM
SHOWS ANY DISC, RAD, OR PARITY ERRORS, THE OPERATOR SHOULD TAKE A
'PSP' AGAIN AND DO A '1COUNT'  (NOTE:  THE OPERATOR CAN 'ALTMODE'
AFTER THE 'INFIL' OR 'OUTFIL' ENTRY IN 1COUNT HAS TYPED OUT).
THE TTY OUTPUT SHOULD BE GIVEN A DATE/TIME AND SYSTEM NUMBER SIGNA-
TURE BY USING THE EXEC 'DATE' AND 'SYS' COMMANDS.

        IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO CLEAN THE TAPE DRIVES BEFORE STARTING
THE DAILY BACKUP.  DOING THIS NOW MAY PREVENT TROUBLE LATER.  DON'T
USE A TAPE DRIVE THAT IS ERROR PRONE.

        NOW YOU SHOULD BEGIN THE FIRST RUN OF THE EVENING BACKUP
BY CALLING THE '1STORE' PROGRAM.  YOU SHOULD INITIALIZE THE TAPE AS
A 'NEW' TAPE AND USE THE 'BACKUP' OPTION.  THIS PICKS UP ALL FILES
ON THE ENTIRE DISC CHANGED OR NEWLY CREATED SINCE THE LAST TIME
THE '1STORE' PROGRAM WAS RUN USING THE 'BACKUP' OPTION.

        IF A TAPE STARTS GETTING ERRORS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, RE-
CLEAN THE TAPE DRIVES.  IF IT CONTINUES, REPLACE THE TAPE WITH A GOOD
USED ONE OR A NEW TAPE.  THE JOB SHOULD BE REDONE ANYTIME THERE ARE
MORE THAN THREE ERRORS - LESS THAN THIS, THE FILES INVOLVED SHOULD
BE STORED AT THE END OF THE TAPE.  SUMBIT A MAR TO MAINTENANCE ON
THE BAD TAPE DRIVE.

        AT THE EFFECTIVE SHUTDOWN TIME, A 'SHUT' IS PLACED IN THE
SYSTEM ALLOWING NO NEW USERS TO ENTER THE SYSTEM.  AFTER THE SYSTEM
IS SHUT, TYPE 'WHO' TO DETERMINE WHO IS STILL LOGGED ON.
IF THERE ARE CUSTOMERS LOGGED ON (THOSE WITHOUT '+' AFTER THE NAME
FIELD) RUN '1LCHECK' TO SEE IF THESE USERS RECEIVED THE SHUTDOWN
LETTER.  IF THE USER HAS NOT RECEIVED THE LETTER, CALL THE '1OPER'
PROGRAM AND SET THE EMERGENCY MESSAGE SWITCH.  (OPTIONAL: ENTER
'1LETTER' PROGRAM AND ISSUE THE 'AGAIN' COMMAND).  WAIT APPROXIMATELY
5-10 MINUTES AND DO ANOTHER 'WHO'.  (A VARIABLE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY
IS POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON THE WORK TO BE DONE).  IF USERS REFUSE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THE SHUTDOWN LETTER, IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE NECESSARY TO
'HANG' THEM OFF THE SYSTEM.

        AT THIS TIME, THE BATCH FILE SHOULD BE CLEARED OUT TO MAKE
SURE THAT A REQUEST WILL NOT REMAIN DORMANT OVERNIGHT.  USE '1CLEAR'
PROGRAM FOR THIS.  ANY BATCH REQUESTS RECEIVED SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE
LEAD OPERATOR OR BATCH CONTROLLER TO LOG IN.

        AFTER DOING THE ABOVE, THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE NIGHT IS STARTED.
THERE ARE THREE PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN THIS:  1STORAGE, 1GASP, AND
1ACCOUNTING (DAILY).  THE 1ACCOUNTING (DAILY) MAY BE POSTPONED DEPENDING
ON THE PRIORITY OF OTHER ACTIVITIES NECESSARY THAT NIGHT.

        AFTER THE ACCOUNTING HAS BEEN COMPLETED (AT LEAST, 1STORAGE
AND 1GASP), THE SECOND 'BACKUP' IS TAKEN.  THIS SHOULD PICK UP ALL
THE FILES CREATED BY THE ACCOUNTING.  THIS INSURES THAT SHOULD SOME-
THING HAPPEN TO THE FILE SYSTEM, THE ACCOUNTING IS STILL AVAILABLE.

        THE TTY HARDCOPY OF 1STORAGE, 1GASP AND 1ACCOUNTING (DAILY)
IS IDENTIFIED WITH THE DATE AND SYSTEM NO. WRITTEN ON IT, AND FILED IN
THE ACCOUNTING FOLDER IN THE BATCH CONTROL AREA.

        AFTER THE SECOND BACKUP IS COMPLETED, AND A DIRECTORY HAS BEEN
PRINTED OF THE TAPE, THE SYSTEM IS TAKEN DOWN BY TYPING 'CRASH' IN
THE EXEC.  WAIT UNTIL THE '940' CONSOLE GOES TO P=77 BEFORE PUTTING
TOGGLE SWITCH IN 'IDLE' AND PUSHING THE 'START' BUTTON.  (USUALLY
ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS WAIT).  NEXT, CHANGE THE TELETYPE FUNCTION BOX TO
'SELECTOR CHANNEL'.  AN 'ERRORS;G' SHOULD BE TAKEN FOLLOWED BY A
'RSTE;G' TO RESET THE ERROR COUNTERS.  WRITE THE SYSTEM NUMBER, DATE,
HARDWARE LETTER, AND PACK SET NUMBER ON THE TERMINAL HARDCOPY BEFORE
GIVING IT TO THE LEAD OPERATOR OR BATCH CONTROLLER.

        IF THERE IS NO ACTIVITY SCHEDULED FOR THAT NIGHT THE SYSTEM
SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK UP.  CONSULT THE TYMCOM-IX BRINGUP DOCU-
MENT FOR THIS PROCEDURE.

      FILES AND ASK FOR  THE JOB NUMBER. YOU SHOULD ENTER  ALL THE INFOR--
      MATION ON THE REQUEST AS ASKED FOR. AFTER  YOU HAVE ENTERED THE INFOR-
      MATION IT WILL ASK IF ALL IS CORRECT AND YOU MAY  ANSWER  Y OR  N
      IF N IS USED IT WILL ASK YOU WHAT NUMBER YOU WANT TO CHANGE, YOU
      SHOULD ENTER AT THAT TIME THE NUMBER YOU WISH TO CHANGE. IF Y
      WAS USED IT WILL ASK YOU  IF THERE IS ANOTHER JOB FOR THIS
      REQUEST AND YOU MAY ENTER EITHER Y OR N. IF N IS USED IT WILL ASK
      YOU IF THERE IS ANOTHER JOB TO  ENTER. IF YES THEN YOU FOLLOW THE
      SAME PROCEEDURE  . IF N THEN THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE.


      -BATCH C.R.
      IS THIS REQUEST FOR INHOUSE (Y OR N): Y  C.R.
      THE PROGRAM WILL PRINT OUT THE PROCESSING NUMBER AND THE
      DATE AND TIME ALONG WITH THE ACCOUNT  AND USER NAME YOU ARE  LOGGED
      INTO AT THAT TIME. IT THEN WILL ASK FOR OTHER INFORMATION AND YOU
      SHOULD JUST SIMPLY ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS AS THEY COME OUT. THE
      WORK TO BE PERFORMED: IS TERMINATED BY A CONTROL D. THE DELIVERY
      INSTRUCTIONS ARE ALSO TERMINATED  WITH A CONTROL D.
      WHEN THE DELIVERY  INSTRUCTIONS ARE TERMINATED THE PROGRAM WILL
      TERMINATE AND PUT THE REQUEST IN THE 1CLEAR REGISTER TO BE CLEARED
      OUT BY THE OPERATOR.

           THE SYSTEM WILL RESPOND WITH THE MESSAGE 
           TOGGLE BREAKPOINT 1. THE OPERATOR WILL TOGGLE THE 
           BREAKPOINT AND THE SYSTEM WILL BRU TO 77 WHICH IS A
           MONITOR CRASH.  THE CELL IS CALLED MONCR

            REMENBER TO WAIT FOR THE SYSTEM TO COME TO P=77 BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE.
            IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO WAIT 15 SECONDS AND THEN PRESS START BUTTON
            ON THE CONSOLE AND MOVE THE 'RUN-IDLE-STEP' SWITCH TO IDLE.

                             -----------------------
     
     INTRODUCTION
     ------------
     
     CARDS TO BE READ INTO THE TYMSHARE SYSTEM ARE SENT OR DELIVERED TO THE
     COMPUTER CENTER BY THE REQUESTOR.  PRIOR TO SUCH DELIVERY, THE USER
     SHOULD HAVE ENTERED A BATCH REQUEST SAYING THAT THE CARDS ARE TO BE
     SENT.  ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION IS ASKED BY THE BATCH PROGRAM.  DATE,
     NAME, PHONE NUMBER, COMPANY NAME, ETC., ARE ALL THERE FOR ACCURATE 
     IDENTIFICATION BY OPERATIONS.  IF THIS CAN'T BE DONE, THEN THE REQUESTOR
     SHOULD HAVE AN ENCLOSURE WITH THE CARDS WITH THE BATCH REQUEST NUMBER,
     THE COMPANY, AND THE TELEPHONE NUMBER.  NOTHING IS BETTER THAN THAT
     TTY OUTPUT.  CARD DECKS SHOULD BE LABELED ON THE DECK AND A DIAGONAL 
     LINE DRAWN ACROSS THE TOP OF THE DECK FROM CORNER TO CORNER.  STANDARD
     POLICY IS TO HOLD THE CARDS FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN DESTROY THEM.  SEND
     MAIL TO USER TELLING HIM THAT CARDS WILL BE DESTROYED IN TWO WEEKS IF
     DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT RECEIVED.  CARDS ARE READ INTO THE 
     SYSTEM IN THE EARLY MORNING BY GRAVE SHIFT.  IF A CUSTOMER WISHES TO
     HAVE CARDS PUNCHED ON SPECIAL STOCK, OPERATIONS WILL DO THIS IF THE 
     SPECIAL CARDS ARE PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER.  WHETHER READING OR PUNCHING
     CARDS, FORMAT TYPE (IBM 026 OR IBM 029) MUST BE SPECIFIED.  NO
     PUNCHING OF BINARY FILES IS PERFORMED.  THE TREATMENT OF
     TRAILING BLANKS MUST ALSO BE SPECIFIED ON CARDS BEING READ.
     
     VALID COMMANDS
     --------------
     
            BREAKPOINT (BPT) 1 SET  -SKIP INSTRUCTIONS.
     
            BPT 2 SET               -READ CARDS TO MAG TAPE UNIT 1.  DO
                                     NOT REMOVE EXCESS BLANKS FROM CARDS.
     
            BPT 2 AND 3 SET         -READ CARDS TO MAG TAPE UNIT 1.  REMOVE
                                     EXCESS BLANKS FROM CARDS.
     
            BPT 3 SET               -PUNCH CARDS TO MAG TAPE UNIT 1.
     
            BPT 4 NOT SET           -READ OR PUNCH CARDS IN 026 FORMAT.
     
            BPT 4 SET               -READ OR PUNCH CARDS IN 029 FORMAT.
     
       (NOTE: THE 3 ENTRIES BELOW ARE PUNCHES USED ON CARD DECKS TO
        SPECIFY THE FORMAT OF THE DECK. THESE WOULD BE AT THE FRONT
        OF THE DECK AND IF SO, THEY HAVE THE EFFECT OF OVERRIDING
        THE BREAKPOINT 4 FORMAT SETTING.)

            12-0-2-4-6-8            -PUNCH IN COLUMN 1 OF THE FIRST CARD
                                     CAUSES THE CARD FILE TO BE READ IN 029
                                     FORMAT.
     
            11-1-3-5-7-9            -PUNCH IN COLUMN 1 OF THE FIRST CARD
                                     CAUSES THE CARD FILE TO BE READ IN 026
                                     FORMAT.
     
            12-0-2-3-4-6-8          -PUNCH IN COLUMN 1 OF THE FIRST CARD
                                     CAUSES THE CARD FILE TO BE READ IN
                                     BINARY FORMAT.
     
            A CARD WITH COLUMN 1 COMPLETELY PUNCHED OUT WILL BE RECOGNIZED
            AS END OF FILE, EVEN IN BINARY FORMAT.
     
     PREPARATION FOR PUNCHING
     ------------------------
     
     UPON RECEIVING A PERIPHERAL PROCESSING REQUEST (PPR), BETTER KNOWN AS
     A BATCH REQUEST, REQUESTING CARDS BE PUNCHED, THE OPERATOR MUST 
     STORE THESE FILES ON A GOOD SCRATCH TAPE.  IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE TO 
     STORE THESE FILES AT LEAST TWICE ON THE TAPE.  BEFORE PUNCHING FILES 
     FROM THE TAPE, CHECK THE PPR TO SEE IF THEY ARE TO BE PUNCHED IN IBM 026
     OR IBM 029 FORMAT.  THE REQUEST WILL STATE 'EBCDIC' OR '029' FOR 029
     FORMAT PUNCHING.  ALL OTHERS WILL BE PUNCHED USING 026 FORMAT.
     CARD PUNCHING IS PERFORMED ON THE 940'S DURING NON-TIMESHARING HOURS.
     
     OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
     ----------------------
     
            A.  WITH THE OPERATOR TTY IN SELECTOR CHANNEL MODE, TYPE IN
     
                    UP;G
     
                THE OPERATOR TTY WILL RESPOND WITH:
     
                    HOST NUMBER: (NN)  ((NN)=SYSTEM NUMBER YOU ARE BRINGING
                                        UP.  THIS NUMBER IS TYPED IN BY THE
                                        OPERATOR)
     
                    LOC: (NN)          ((NN)=DISC LOCATION.  NORMALLY THE 
                                        DISC LOCATION IS 16 TYPED IN BY THE
                                        OPERATOR)
     
                WHEN THE 940 IS LOADED, THE FOLLOWING RESPONSE WILL APPEAR
                ON THE OPERATORS TTY:
     
                    940 LOADED
     
            B.  TURN ON THE MAINTENANCE TTY, NEXT TO, OR NEAR THE TAPE DRIVES,
     AFTER MAKING SURE IT IS CONNECTED TO THE CORRECT SYSTEM, AND PUT PUNCH
     IN READY.  BEFORE PLACING CARDS IN STACKER, SHUFFLE THEM SO THEY DO NOT
     STICK TOGETHER, AND THEN PLACE THEM FACE DOWN WITH 9 EDGE LEADING.
     MOUNT TAPE ON MAG TAPE UNIT 1 AND PUT IN READY.
     
            C.  AT THE 940 CONSOLE, SET BREAKPOINTS 1 AND 3, IF YOU ARE 
     PUNCHING IN IBM 026 FORMAT; BREAKPOINTS 1, 3 AND 4, IF YOU ARE PUNCHING
     IBM 029 FORMAT.  IF YOU REQUIRE INSTRUCTIONS DO NOT SET BREAKPOINT
     1 AND THE INSTRUCTIONS OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 2 ABOVE WILL BE PRINTED
     OUT.  PRESS START AND THEN PUT THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH TO STEP, IDLE, RUN.
     THE 940 IS NOW READY FOR CARD PUNCHING.
     
            D.  AFTER PUNCHING THE CARDS FROM THE TAPE POSITIONS, THE CARDS
     ARE REMOVED AND A RUBBER BAND(S) IS/ARE PLACED AROUND THEM.  THE FIRST
     CARD WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:
     
                    (1) PPR NUMBER (REQUEST NO.)
     
                    (2) FILE NAME (NAME OF FILE PUNCHED)
     
                    (3) NO--OF-- (1 OF 3, 2 OF 3, 3 OF 3)
     
                    (4) FORMAT PUNCHED (026 OR 029)
     
                    (5) CARD COUNT (NO. OF CARDS PUNCHED TAKEN FROM 
                                    MAINTENANCE TTY OUTPUT)
     
                    (6) LARGE DECKS WILL HAVE A DIAGONAL LINE DRAWN
                        ACROSS THE TOP FROM CORNER TO CORNER.
     
     THE ABOVE IS PERFORMED ON EACH DECK OF CARDS THAT IS PUNCHED.  IF YOU
     HAVE A PUNCHING JOB THAT IS LARGE, AND NEED TO USE THE BOXES THE BLANK
     CARDS CAME IN, EACH DECK OF CARDS IS MARKED AS OUTLINED ABOVE AS WELL
     AS THE BOXES.  THE ONLY INFORMATION NOT NEEDED ON THE BOXES IS THE
     FILENAME.
     
            E.  ITEM NO. 3 OF THE PPR IS FILLED IN WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
     PUNCHING THE CARDS REQUESTED.  (I.E. TOTAL NUMBER OF CARDS PUNCHED,
     FORMAT, SYSTEM NO. AND THE HARDWARE ID LETTER).  THE PPR IS INITIALED
     AND DATED WITH THE TIME OF COMPLETION ENTERED.  ATTACH THE MAINTENANCE
     TTY OUTPUT WITH THE CARD COUNT, AND ALL ASSOCIATED PAPERWORK, TO THE PPR
     BEFORE TURNING THE JOB IN TO THE LEAD OPERATOR.  MAKE ONE COPY OF THE
     PPR IF IT IS TO BE PICKED UP AND TWO COPIES OF THE PPR IF THEY ARE TO BE
     MAILED.  THE LEAD OPERATOR, AFTER CHECKING IT OVER FOR ACCURACY, WILL GIVE
     THE PPR TO THE APPROPRIATE OPERATOR FOR ENTERING IN BCHARGE.
     
     READING CARDS
     -------------
     
     NORMALLY, CARD READING IS DONE ON SYSTEM 31 (PDP10), BUT THERE MAY
     BE TIMES WHEN THEY WILL NEED TO BE READ ON THE 940'S.  THE FOLLOWING
     INSTRUCTIONS INSTRUCT YOU ON HOW TO READ CARDS ON THE 940'S.
     
            A.  SEE PARAGRAPH A OF OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE.
     
            B.  TURN ON THE CARD READER.
     
            C.  THE SETTING OF BREAKPOINTS IS THE SAME FOR READING CARDS AS
     IT IS FOR PUNCHING CARDS.  PRESS START AND THEN PUT THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH
     TO STEP, IDLE, RUN.  THE 940 IS NOW READY TO READ CARDS.
     
            D.  ANY MULTIPLE OF BOXES RECEIVED WILL BE READ SEPARATELY AS
     ONE FILE, UNLESS REQUESTOR STATES OTHERWISE.
     

            E.  LEADING BLANK CARDS WILL BE SKIPPED ON CARD READER INPUT.
     IF A DECK CONTAINING LEADING BLANK CARDS IS TO BE READ AND IT IS
     DESIRED THAT THE BLANK CARDS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTING
     TAPE FILE, THEN THE BLANK CARDS SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY A FORMAT CARD.

            F.  THERE ARE THREE FORMAT CARDS WHICH MAY BE PLACED AT THE
     BEGINNING OF A CARD DECK TO OVERRIDE THE SETTING OF BREAKPOINT 4.
     A DECK WHICH CONTAINS A 12-0-2-4-6-8 PUNCH IN COLUMN ONE OF ITS
     FIRST NON-BLANK CARD WILL BE READ IN 029 FORMAT.  A DECK WHICH
     CONTAINS A 11-1-3-5-7-9 PUNCH IN COLUMN ONE OF ITS FIRST NON-CLANK
     CARD WILL BE READ IN 026 FORMAT.  A DECK WHICH CONTAINS A 
     12-0-2-3-4-6-8-9 PUNCH IN COLUMN ONE OF ITS FIRST NON-BLANK CARD
     WILL BE READ IN BINARY FORMAT.

            G.  IN BINARY FORMAT, THE SETTINGS OF BREAKPOINT 3 (TO REMOVE
     EXCESS BLANKS) AND BREAKPOINT 4 (WHICH NORMALLY SELECTS BETWEEN
     029 AND 026 FORMAT) ARE IGNORED.  THE CARD DECK IS READ AS A
     BINARY IMAGE INTO 40-WORD RECORDS WITH TWO 12-BIT COLUMNS PER WORD.
     THE ODD NUMBERED COLUMN WILL BE IN THE LEFT HALF IF THE COLUMNS
     ARE NUMBERED 1-80.

            H.  THE ONLY CARD WHICH CANNOT BE HANDLED IN BINARY MODE 
     IS A CARD WITH COLUMN ONE COMPLETELY PUNCHED, AS THIS WILL BE
     TREATED AS AN END OF FILE.

            I.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO READ A NUMBER OF DECKS AT ONE TIME
     IF EACH IS PRECEDED BY THE APPROPRIATE FORMAT CARD AND FOLLOWED BY
     AN END-OF-FILE CARD.  BLANK CARDS MAY BE INSERTED BETWEEN AN
     END-OF-FILE CARD AND THE FORMAT CARD, IF DESIRED.

            J.  ITEM NO. 2 OF THE PPR IS COMPLETED AFTER READING THE CARDS.
     (I.E. TOTAL NUMBER OF CARDS READ, FORMAT, SYSTEM NO. AND THE HARDWARE
     ID LETTER).  THE PPR IS INITIALED AND DATED WITH THE TIME OF COMPLETION
     ENTERED.  ATTACH THE MAINTENANCE TTY OUTPUT WITH THE CARD READ COUNT,
     AND ALL ASSOCIATED PAPERWORK TO THE PPR, AND TURN THE COMPLETED JOB IN TO
     THE LEAD OPERATOR.  THE LEAD OPERATOR WILL GIVE IT TO THE RESPONSIBLE
     OPERATOR TO RESTORE THE FILE(S) ON THE APPROPRIATE SYSTEM FOR THE USER.
     
     VERIFICATION OF CARDS
     ---------------------
     
     VERIFICATION OF CARDS IS PERFORMED FOR MMI ONLY ON SYSTEM 31.  (THIS
     PROCEDURE WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF SEPARATE DOCUMENTATION).
     
     CARD INTERPRETATION
     -------------------
     
     INTERPRETATION OF CARDS IS NOT PERFORMED AT TYMSHARE OPERATIONS.
