                            CARD PUNCHING AND READING
                             -----------------------
     
     INTRODUCTION
     ------------
     
     CARDS TO BE READ INTO THE TYMSHARE SYSTEM ARE SENT OR DELIVERED TO THE
     COMPUTER CENTER BY THE REQUESTOR.  PRIOR TO SUCH DELIVERY, THE USER
     SHOULD HAVE ENTERED A BATCH REQUEST SAYING THAT THE CARDS ARE TO BE
     SENT.  ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION IS ASKED BY THE BATCH PROGRAM.  DATE,
     NAME, PHONE NUMBER, COMPANY NAME, ETC., ARE ALL THERE FOR ACCURATE 
     IDENTIFICATION BY OPERATIONS.  IF THIS CAN'T BE DONE, THEN THE REQUESTOR
     SHOULD HAVE AN ENCLOSURE WITH THE CARDS WITH THE BATCH REQUEST NUMBER,
     THE COMPANY, AND THE TELEPHONE NUMBER.  NOTHING IS BETTER THAN THAT
     TTY OUTPUT.  CARD DECKS SHOULD BE LABELED ON THE DECK AND A DIAGONAL 
     LINE DRAWN ACROSS THE TOP OF THE DECK FROM CORNER TO CORNER.  STANDARD
     POLICY IS TO HOLD THE CARDS FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN DESTROY THEM.  SEND
     MAIL TO USER TELLING HIM THAT CARDS WILL BE DESTROYED IN TWO WEEKS IF
     DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT RECEIVED.  CARDS ARE READ INTO THE 
     SYSTEM IN THE EARLY MORNING BY GRAVE SHIFT.  IF A CUSTOMER WISHES TO
     HAVE CARDS PUNCHED ON SPECIAL STOCK, OPERATIONS WILL DO THIS IF THE 
     SPECIAL CARDS ARE PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER.  WHETHER READING OR PUNCHING
     CARDS, FORMAT TYPE (IBM 026 OR IBM 029) MUST BE SPECIFIED.  NO
     PUNCHING OF BINARY FILES IS PERFORMED.  THE TREATMENT OF
     TRAILING BLANKS MUST ALSO BE SPECIFIED ON CARDS BEING READ.
     
     VALID COMMANDS
     --------------
     
            BREAKPOINT (BPT) 1 SET  -SKIP INSTRUCTIONS.
     
            BPT 2 SET               -READ CARDS TO MAG TAPE UNIT 1.  DO
                                     NOT REMOVE EXCESS BLANKS FROM CARDS.
     
            BPT 2 AND 3 SET         -READ CARDS TO MAG TAPE UNIT 1.  REMOVE
                                     EXCESS BLANKS FROM CARDS.
     
            BPT 3 SET               -PUNCH CARDS TO MAG TAPE UNIT 1.
     
            BPT 4 NOT SET           -READ OR PUNCH CARDS IN 026 FORMAT.
     
            BPT 4 SET               -READ OR PUNCH CARDS IN 029 FORMAT.
     
       (NOTE: THE 3 ENTRIES BELOW ARE PUNCHES USED ON CARD DECKS TO
        SPECIFY THE FORMAT OF THE DECK. THESE WOULD BE AT THE FRONT
        OF THE DECK AND IF SO, THEY HAVE THE EFFECT OF OVERRIDING
        THE BREAKPOINT 4 FORMAT SETTING.)

            12-0-2-4-6-8            -PUNCH IN COLUMN 1 OF THE FIRST CARD
                                     CAUSES THE CARD FILE TO BE READ IN 029
                                     FORMAT.
     
            11-1-3-5-7-9            -PUNCH IN COLUMN 1 OF THE FIRST CARD
                                     CAUSES THE CARD FILE TO BE READ IN 026
                                     FORMAT.
     
            12-0-2-3-4-6-8          -PUNCH IN COLUMN 1 OF THE FIRST CARD
                                     CAUSES THE CARD FILE TO BE READ IN
                                     BINARY FORMAT.
     
            A CARD WITH COLUMN 1 COMPLETELY PUNCHED OUT WILL BE RECOGNIZED
            AS END OF FILE, EVEN IN BINARY FORMAT.
     
     PREPARATION FOR PUNCHING
     ------------------------
     
     UPON RECEIVING A PERIPHERAL PROCESSING REQUEST (PPR), BETTER KNOWN AS
     A BATCH REQUEST, REQUESTING CARDS BE PUNCHED, THE OPERATOR MUST 
     STORE THESE FILES ON A GOOD SCRATCH TAPE.  IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE TO 
     STORE THESE FILES AT LEAST TWICE ON THE TAPE.  BEFORE PUNCHING FILES 
     FROM THE TAPE, CHECK THE PPR TO SEE IF THEY ARE TO BE PUNCHED IN IBM 026
     OR IBM 029 FORMAT.  THE REQUEST WILL STATE 'EBCDIC' OR '029' FOR 029
     FORMAT PUNCHING.  ALL OTHERS WILL BE PUNCHED USING 026 FORMAT.
     CARD PUNCHING IS PERFORMED ON THE 940'S DURING NON-TIMESHARING HOURS.
     
     OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
     ----------------------
     
            A.  WITH THE OPERATOR TTY IN SELECTOR CHANNEL MODE, TYPE IN
     
                    UP;G
     
                THE OPERATOR TTY WILL RESPOND WITH:
     
                    HOST NUMBER: (NN)  ((NN)=SYSTEM NUMBER YOU ARE BRINGING
                                        UP.  THIS NUMBER IS TYPED IN BY THE
                                        OPERATOR)
     
                    LOC: (NN)          ((NN)=DISC LOCATION.  NORMALLY THE 
                                        DISC LOCATION IS 16 TYPED IN BY THE
                                        OPERATOR)
     
                WHEN THE 940 IS LOADED, THE FOLLOWING RESPONSE WILL APPEAR
                ON THE OPERATORS TTY:
     
                    940 LOADED
     
            B.  TURN ON THE MAINTENANCE TTY, NEXT TO, OR NEAR THE TAPE DRIVES,
     AFTER MAKING SURE IT IS CONNECTED TO THE CORRECT SYSTEM, AND PUT PUNCH
     IN READY.  BEFORE PLACING CARDS IN STACKER, SHUFFLE THEM SO THEY DO NOT
     STICK TOGETHER, AND THEN PLACE THEM FACE DOWN WITH 9 EDGE LEADING.
     MOUNT TAPE ON MAG TAPE UNIT 1 AND PUT IN READY.
     
            C.  AT THE 940 CONSOLE, SET BREAKPOINTS 1 AND 3, IF YOU ARE 
     PUNCHING IN IBM 026 FORMAT; BREAKPOINTS 1, 3 AND 4, IF YOU ARE PUNCHING
     IBM 029 FORMAT.  IF YOU REQUIRE INSTRUCTIONS DO NOT SET BREAKPOINT
     1 AND THE INSTRUCTIONS OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 2 ABOVE WILL BE PRINTED
     OUT.  PRESS START AND THEN PUT THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH TO STEP, IDLE, RUN.
     THE 940 IS NOW READY FOR CARD PUNCHING.
     
            D.  AFTER PUNCHING THE CARDS FROM THE TAPE POSITIONS, THE CARDS
     ARE REMOVED AND A RUBBER BAND(S) IS/ARE PLACED AROUND THEM.  THE FIRST
     CARD WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:
     
                    (1) PPR NUMBER (REQUEST NO.)
     
                    (2) FILE NAME (NAME OF FILE PUNCHED)
     
                    (3) NO--OF-- (1 OF 3, 2 OF 3, 3 OF 3)
     
                    (4) FORMAT PUNCHED (026 OR 029)
     
                    (5) CARD COUNT (NO. OF CARDS PUNCHED TAKEN FROM 
                                    MAINTENANCE TTY OUTPUT)
     
                    (6) LARGE DECKS WILL HAVE A DIAGONAL LINE DRAWN
                        ACROSS THE TOP FROM CORNER TO CORNER.
     
     THE ABOVE IS PERFORMED ON EACH DECK OF CARDS THAT IS PUNCHED.  IF YOU
     HAVE A PUNCHING JOB THAT IS LARGE, AND NEED TO USE THE BOXES THE BLANK
     CARDS CAME IN, EACH DECK OF CARDS IS MARKED AS OUTLINED ABOVE AS WELL
     AS THE BOXES.  THE ONLY INFORMATION NOT NEEDED ON THE BOXES IS THE
     FILENAME.
     
            E.  ITEM NO. 3 OF THE PPR IS FILLED IN WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
     PUNCHING THE CARDS REQUESTED.  (I.E. TOTAL NUMBER OF CARDS PUNCHED,
     FORMAT, SYSTEM NO. AND THE HARDWARE ID LETTER).  THE PPR IS INITIALED
     AND DATED WITH THE TIME OF COMPLETION ENTERED.  ATTACH THE MAINTENANCE
     TTY OUTPUT WITH THE CARD COUNT, AND ALL ASSOCIATED PAPERWORK, TO THE PPR
     BEFORE TURNING THE JOB IN TO THE LEAD OPERATOR.  MAKE ONE COPY OF THE
     PPR IF IT IS TO BE PICKED UP AND TWO COPIES OF THE PPR IF THEY ARE TO BE
     MAILED.  THE LEAD OPERATOR, AFTER CHECKING IT OVER FOR ACCURACY, WILL GIVE
     THE PPR TO THE APPROPRIATE OPERATOR FOR ENTERING IN BCHARGE.
     
     READING CARDS
     -------------
     
     NORMALLY, CARD READING IS DONE ON SYSTEM 31 (PDP10), BUT THERE MAY
     BE TIMES WHEN THEY WILL NEED TO BE READ ON THE 940'S.  THE FOLLOWING
     INSTRUCTIONS INSTRUCT YOU ON HOW TO READ CARDS ON THE 940'S.
     
            A.  SEE PARAGRAPH A OF OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE.
     
            B.  TURN ON THE CARD READER.
     
            C.  THE SETTING OF BREAKPOINTS IS THE SAME FOR READING CARDS AS
     IT IS FOR PUNCHING CARDS.  PRESS START AND THEN PUT THE RUN/IDLE SWITCH
     TO STEP, IDLE, RUN.  THE 940 IS NOW READY TO READ CARDS.
     
            D.  ANY MULTIPLE OF BOXES RECEIVED WILL BE READ SEPARATELY AS
     ONE FILE, UNLESS REQUESTOR STATES OTHERWISE.
     

            E.  LEADING BLANK CARDS WILL BE SKIPPED ON CARD READER INPUT.
     IF A DECK CONTAINING LEADING BLANK CARDS IS TO BE READ AND IT IS
     DESIRED THAT THE BLANK CARDS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTING
     TAPE FILE, THEN THE BLANK CARDS SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY A FORMAT CARD.

            F.  THERE ARE THREE FORMAT CARDS WHICH MAY BE PLACED AT THE
     BEGINNING OF A CARD DECK TO OVERRIDE THE SETTING OF BREAKPOINT 4.
     A DECK WHICH CONTAINS A 12-0-2-4-6-8 PUNCH IN COLUMN ONE OF ITS
     FIRST NON-BLANK CARD WILL BE READ IN 029 FORMAT.  A DECK WHICH
     CONTAINS A 11-1-3-5-7-9 PUNCH IN COLUMN ONE OF ITS FIRST NON-CLANK
     CARD WILL BE READ IN 026 FORMAT.  A DECK WHICH CONTAINS A 
     12-0-2-3-4-6-8-9 PUNCH IN COLUMN ONE OF ITS FIRST NON-BLANK CARD
     WILL BE READ IN BINARY FORMAT.

            G.  IN BINARY FORMAT, THE SETTINGS OF BREAKPOINT 3 (TO REMOVE
     EXCESS BLANKS) AND BREAKPOINT 4 (WHICH NORMALLY SELECTS BETWEEN
     029 AND 026 FORMAT) ARE IGNORED.  THE CARD DECK IS READ AS A
     BINARY IMAGE INTO 40-WORD RECORDS WITH TWO 12-BIT COLUMNS PER WORD.
     THE ODD NUMBERED COLUMN WILL BE IN THE LEFT HALF IF THE COLUMNS
     ARE NUMBERED 1-80.

            H.  THE ONLY CARD WHICH CANNOT BE HANDLED IN BINARY MODE 
     IS A CARD WITH COLUMN ONE COMPLETELY PUNCHED, AS THIS WILL BE
     TREATED AS AN END OF FILE.

            I.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO READ A NUMBER OF DECKS AT ONE TIME
     IF EACH IS PRECEDED BY THE APPROPRIATE FORMAT CARD AND FOLLOWED BY
     AN END-OF-FILE CARD.  BLANK CARDS MAY BE INSERTED BETWEEN AN
     END-OF-FILE CARD AND THE FORMAT CARD, IF DESIRED.

            J.  ITEM NO. 2 OF THE PPR IS COMPLETED AFTER READING THE CARDS.
     (I.E. TOTAL NUMBER OF CARDS READ, FORMAT, SYSTEM NO. AND THE HARDWARE
     ID LETTER).  THE PPR IS INITIALED AND DATED WITH THE TIME OF COMPLETION
     ENTERED.  ATTACH THE MAINTENANCE TTY OUTPUT WITH THE CARD READ COUNT,
     AND ALL ASSOCIATED PAPERWORK TO THE PPR, AND TURN THE COMPLETED JOB IN TO
     THE LEAD OPERATOR.  THE LEAD OPERATOR WILL GIVE IT TO THE RESPONSIBLE
     OPERATOR TO RESTORE THE FILE(S) ON THE APPROPRIATE SYSTEM FOR THE USER.
     
     VERIFICATION OF CARDS
     ---------------------
     
     VERIFICATION OF CARDS IS PERFORMED FOR MMI ONLY ON SYSTEM 31.  (THIS
     PROCEDURE WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF SEPARATE DOCUMENTATION).
     
     CARD INTERPRETATION
     -------------------
     
     INTERPRETATION OF CARDS IS NOT PERFORMED AT TYMSHARE OPERATIONS.
