:C: SINGLE HOST DIM
                               SINGLE HOST DIM ROUTINES
                               ------------------------

    THE FOLOWING ROUTINES MAY NOW BE USED IN DIM DURING NON-TIME
SHARING HOURS.

    1. N,UP@
              BRINGS UP THE 940. N=SYSTEM NUMBER (USUALLY 2)
    2. FORMAT@
              FORMATS DISC PACK NUMBER 7. ANY ERRORS ENCOUNTERED WILL BE
              TYPED ON THE 620 TTY AND THE ROUTINE WILL CONTINUE.
    3. ERRORS@
              TYPES ANY DISC ERRORS THAT HAVE OCURRED WHILE THIS PARTICULAR
              DIM HAS BEEN RUNNING. TYPING 2,UP@ WILL BRING IN A NEW 620
              DIM AND DESTROY THIS INFORMATION.
    4. NUR@ AND NUW@
              THESE TWO ROUTINES READ (NUR@) OR WRITE THEN READ (NUW@)
              KNOWN DATA ON TEST PACK 3. THE DATA READ IS CHECKED AGAINST
              THE KNOWN PATTERN. ANY DATA COMPARE ERRORS OR I/O ERRORS
              ARE TYPED OUT AS THEY OCCUR. AT THE BEGINNING A
              SHORT SEEK TEST IS MADE TO EVERY CYLINDER AND HEAD NUMBER AND
              THE MESSAGE 'SEEK PASS COMPLETE' IS TYPED WHEN DONE. A SHORT
              (15 MIN) COMMAND CHAIN PASS IS THEN MADE, FOLLOWED BY A DATA
              CHAIN PASS (15 MIN). AFTER THIS MORE THOROUGH TESTS ARE MADE
              THESE TESTS WILL RUN FOR HOURS.
    5. TSTPK@
              THIS ROUTINE WRITES THE TEST PATTERN ON PACK #3.
              TIME: 40 MINUTES
              IF YOU HAVE A MASTER TEST PACK YOU MAY USE THE REGULAR TIME
              SHARING PACKCOPY ROUTINE TO MAKE A TEST PACK. THIS TAKES ABOUT
              5 MIN. (SEE PACKCOPY DOC.)

    NOTE: PUTTING SENSE SWITCH 1 UP WILL STOP ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WHILE THEY
              THEY ARE RUNNING. STOPPING THEM ANY OTHER WAY MAY CAUSE 
              ERRONEOUS DISC ERRORS.

              THE TEST PACK (#3) SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH NUR@ OR NUW@.
              USING IT WITH THE 'S' PLUG IN CE MODE WILL RUIN THE FORMAT.
              IF THIS HAPPENS THE PACK MUST BE FORMMATTED BEFORE BEING
              USED AGAIN. FORMATTING A PACK WRITES ZEROES IN ALL DATA FIELDS.
              THE 620  CRASH LOCATION IS AT OCTAL 77. IF THE 620 GOES INTO STEP
              AT ANY OTHER LOCATION, DO THE FOLLOWING:
              1. TAKE THE 940 DOWN.
              2. PUT SENSE SWITCH 3 UP ON THE 620 AND START THE 620 AT
                 LOCATION 0.
              THIS WILL GIVE YOU A DIM CRASH WHEN YOU BRING THE 940 UP AGAIN.
