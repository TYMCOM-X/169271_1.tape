     Committee.  Its members are:

                     Mike Becker                     Gary Liebl
                     Jerry Causley                   Leo Mirowitz

                     Bob Fischer                     Paul Wiedenmann


     This group will meet monthly to make participative decisions on 
     important ISG matters.

     A second new group, the ISG Management Council, will meet in 
     conjunction with each Quarterly Review.  The Council's members 
     are:

                     Mike Becker                     Vern Hart
                     Ted Bellan                      Gene Horn
                     Otis Brinkley                   Gary Liebl
                     Rich Calvert                    Leo Mirowitz

                     Bob Fischer                     Buck Yoder

     The Management Council will provide feedback on a full range of 
     business unit and staff activities.  Together, these groups 
     constitute a valuable communications and participative management 
     tool that can go far to enhance and support ISG's short-term and 
     long-term strategies.

          It is important to note that this chart shows only reporting 
          relationships, not rank.

          our recent top management changes.

     To:          MDC-HQ and Corporate Office Lists A-D

     Subject:     FORMATION OF ISG FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION 
                  ORGANIZATION


     I am pleased to announce, effective immediately, the formation 
     of the ISG Finance and Administration Organization and 
     appointments to key positions in that organization.

     D. J. (Woody) Garrity is appointed Staff Vice President - 
     Administration for ISG.  Based in St. Louis, Woody will be 
     responsible for policy formulation and coordination of ISG 
     consolidated reporting and other special tasks in the areas of 
     management information systems, policy management, facilities, 
     procurement, and export control.  In addition, he will continue 
     to direct the centralized administrative support activities in 
     St. Louis.  These activities will not become part of the Group 
     staff; it is our intention to transfer substantially all of the 
     operations aspects of the centralized administration support 
     activities to the business units, while creating a lean policy 
     formulation and coordination staff at the Group level during 
     the next two months.  In the case of Information Resource 
     Management, however, this transfer will be timed with the 
     establishment of fully functional financial systems and 
     organizations in the business units.

     Ray A. Mundloch is appointed Controller for ISG.  Ray will be 
     based in St. Louis and will be responsible for establishing 
     accounting policy, reporting calendars and formats, and for 
     preparation of the monthly Group financial statements.  In 
     addition, he will monitor compliance with generally accepted 
     accounting principles, with ISG and Corporate accounting 
     policies and practices, and with the system of internal 
     accounting controls in each ISG business unit.  He will also 
     serve as the Corporate interface for historical financial 
     data.  Ray will continue to be responsible for the centralized 
     finance support center in St. Louis.  As with the centralized 
     administrative activities, these functions will not become part 
     of the Group staff.  As previously announced, the goal is to 
     achieve business unit independence and to have the people in 
     this centralized organization placed within those business 
     units no later than the end of 1986.

     I will function, on an acting basis, as Staff Vice President - 
     Financial Planning and Analysis for the Group.  The 
     responsibilities of this position are forward-looking in nature 
     and include working with each of the ISG business units on the 
     annual operating plan, forecasts and outlooks, and on reviews 
     of special financial studies and proposals.  This function will 
     also prepare and publish forward-looking consolidated ISG 
     financial information and will serve as the Corporate interface 
     for this information.







     A. J. (Arnie) Hyde is appointed to the position of Director - 
     International Financial Planning and Analysis.  In this capacity, 
     Arnie will be located in Hemel Hempstead, England, and work with 
     both the Staff Vice President - Financial Planning and Analysis 
     and with the Group Controller on financial matters pertaining to 
     McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company - UK and 
     McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International Company.  
     Additionally, he will serve as the Finance Director of McDonnell 
     Douglas UK Ltd. (MDUKL), with special emphasis on UK tax and cash 
     coordination activities for ISG and for McDonnell Douglas.

     Woody and Ray will soon be publishing additional administrative 
     bulletins describing their functions in more detail and 
     announcing appointments.

     Subject:     FORMATION OF ISG HUMAN RESOURCES ORGANIZATION



     Effective immediately, Mike Becker is appointed Staff 
     Vice President - Human Resources for the ISG.  In his new 
     position, Mike will report to me and will be responsible for 
     Group Human Resource activities which include:

          -   Policy Formulation and Coordination

          -   Compensation and Benefits

          -   Human Resource Management

          -   Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action

          -   Employee Attitude Surveys

          -   Human Resource support for Group staff organizations

     Mike is also responsible for coordinating activities among the 
     Human Resource organizations within the business units.

     In addition, two important programs that require consistent 
     administration across all of ISG will report to Mike:

          -   Management and Professional Development, under 
              Ken Best.  (Other training activities, including 
              technical, sales, and product- or job-specific skills 
              training will be the responsibility of the individual 
              business units.)

          -   Placement, Advancement, Counseling and Training (PACT), 
              under Jerry Sexauer.

     Both of these programs benefit the entire ISG and are most 
     appropriately administered at the Group level.

     One of the ISG's most important goals is to achieve business 
     unit independence and to decentralize as many staff functions as 
     possible by no later than the end of 1986.  In the meantime, we 
     will use regional support centers to provide staff support for 
     those business units that are not yet self-sufficient.  In the 
     area of Human Resources, this approach will be carried out as 
     follows:



          -   Wylie Taylor is responsible for Human Resource support 
              for McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.  He 
              will have a parallel responsibility for companies in 
              the West which do not have their own Human Resource 
              functions.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company

              -   Group Staff organizations located on the West Coast

              Wylie reports to Vern Smith, President, 
              McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

          -   In the East, a position for managing Human Resource 
              support, yet to be filled, will report to me.  Until an 
              appropriate individual is named to this position, 
              Mike Becker will have acting responsibility to provide 
              Human Resource support for the following companies:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering 
                  Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Processing Company

              -   MSGI, Dynatax and Unitax

          -   Human Resource organizations that already exist within 
              business units will continue to support their 
              individual business units.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International 
                  Company

     ISG now has an efficient Human Resource framework.  Further 
     announcements will be made in the coming months as staffing 
     decisions are made at the Group and business unit level.  In the 
     meantime, I urge you to cooperate with all Human Resource staffs 
     as they work to provide us with effective and responsive Human 
     Resource support.

     Effective immediately, Bernie Hathaway is appointed Vice 
     President - Productivity for ISG, reporting to me.  In this 
     position, Bernie will be responsible for championing 
     productivity programs for all ISG business units and will work 
     with the business units to develop effective productivity 
     improvement activities that are consistent with both ISG and MDC 
     standards and objectives.

     To facilitate this process, productivity executives representing 
     each business unit will report to Bernie on a dotted line basis 
     as they implement productivity activities appropriate to their 
     respective business units.

     Bernie's first order of business will be to assimilate all 
     former Blue Sector productivity efforts and integrate them with 
     former Gold Sector activities.  I am counting on your support 
     for Bernie's efforts to provide a practical and efficient 
     framework for coordinating ISG's activities in the vitally 
     important area of productivity improvement.

     Subject:     CHANGES IN FORMER BLUE/GOLD SECTOR STAFF FUNCTIONS



     Dissolution of the ISG sectors has required us to reassign 
     several staff activities, including the following:

         -    Library Services (St. Louis) is now the responsibility 
              of Ted Bellan, President - McDonnell Douglas 
              Information Processing Company.

         -    Guest Services (St. Louis) is now the responsibility of 
              Dave Rousseau, Staff Vice President - ISG Marketing.  
              This function currently provides an executive briefing 
              suite for use by all ISG businesses.  As budgets 
              permit, ISG  executive briefing facilities will be 
              opened in additional locations.

         -    Dick Schenk, formerly Director of Planning - ISG Blue 
              Sector, will, along with his organization, report to 
              Gary Liebl.  As Director - Operating Planning for ISG, 
              Dick will assist Gary in developing, analyzing, and 
              managing ISG business unit operating plans, for which 
              Gary is now responsible as Group Operating Officer.

         -    Alan Griffiths, formerly Director - Strategic Planning 
              for the Gold Sector, will now report to Wayne Hudgins, 
              Director of Planning - ISG, to consolidate ISG-wide 
              planning within the Group Marketing and Planning 
              function.  Alan brings a depth of experience in 
              technology consulting that will be invaluable to ISG's 
              strategic planning.

     Other steps involved in our transition to a unified ISG are 
     outlined in other ISG Administrative Bulletins.

     Effective immediately, Charlie Dignan, ISG's Staff Vice President 
     - Corporate Accounts, will report to me.  Charlie formerly 
     reported to John McDonnell, Chairman of the ISG Executive Board.

     Charlie will continue his efforts to ensure that ISG appropriately 
     coordinates its sales activities within our very largest accounts 
     and prospects.

     I am counting on you to give Charlie your support as he works with 
     us to ensure that ISG provides the best possible customer service 
     and that we identify all the business opportunities that our 
     biggest customers represent.

Subject:      MCDONNELL DOUGLAS COMPUTER SYSTEMS COMPANY 
              MANUFACTURING OPERATION, REDEFINITION OF 
              RESPONSIBILITIES


The reorganization of the Gold Sector Manufacturing Operation 
was announced by Gary E. Liebl, ISG Executive Board Member, 
in his Administrative Bulletin 85-031, dated March 18, 1985.  
The reorganization announced at that time was in response to 
the recommendation made by the Special Task Force formed in 
1984 with the purpose of determining how the capabilities of 
all the manufacturing and procurement resources within ISG 
could best be utilized strategically and tactically.

As the needs of the Computer Systems Company and the 
Information Systems Group increase requiring more of my time 
and attention, I find it necessary at this time to remove 
myself from the acting position of Senior Vice President, 
Manufacturing.

Greg Lawson will continue to function with the title of Vice 
President, Manufacturing for the McDonnell Douglas Computer 
Systems Company.  In addition, however, as an expansion and 
redefinition of his responsiblities, Greg will assume full 
direction of the worldwide manufacturing operations of the 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.  Greg's 
additional responsibilities become effective June 10, 1985.

Reporting directly to Greg will be the people with 
manufacturing responsibilities formerly reporting to me.  
They are:  Barrie Laver, Director & General Manager, 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Limited;  Willie Jones, 
Managing Director, Microdata - Limited, Barbados;  John Lee, 
Director, Manufacturing Control;  Bob Smith, Director, 
Product Assurance;  Jim Ball, Vice President - General 
Manager, Distributed Systems Company and Thom Kelley, 
Director, Tymnet Manufacturing.

Your support of Greg in his expanded role, his direct reports 
and all engaged in the manufacturing process, will be 
sincerely appreciated.

     Subject: PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT:  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
              INFORMATION PROCESSING COMPANY - DATA CENTER 
              OPERATIONS




     1.  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I announce the 
         appointment of A. Ann Lazerus to the position of 
         Director, Production Services - St. Louis, within MDIPC 
         Data Center Operations.  She is replacing Dave D. Borlin 
         who has accepted a key position within the Corporate IRM 
         Staff function.

     2.  Ann will be responsible for St. Louis based data 
         processing services that support ISG shared processing 
         and dedicated processing.  Such services include IBM and 
         CDC based mainframe services, Data Entry, Data Control 
         and Data Output operations and all associated Production 
         Support processes such as Storage Management, Scheduling 
         and Quality Control.

     3.  Ann's career in data processing began in 1962 with System 
         Development Corporation and has continued to progress 
         within and outside of McDonnell Douglas Corporation with 
         increasing technical and managerial responsibilities.  
         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the 
         University of California at Berkeley in 1974.

     4.  Her most recent assignment is that of a chair position in 
         ISG's Professional and Managerial Development Program.  
         Ann was among the first group accepted into this vital 
         ISG program.  Her previous position was Manager, 
         Production Audit, within the McDonnell Douglas Health 
         Information Systems Group.









     5.  Concurrent with this promotion of Ann, we send our 
         heartfelt appreciation and best wishes to Dave Borlin as 
         he moves into his new role.

     6.  Your cooperation and support of Ann in this position that 
         is so vital to customer satisfaction will be appreciated.

TERRY FUJIMOTO'S SECRETARY         Debbie Jones
 
THEIR MISSION . . . .
 
The organization's mission, according to Terry, is to bring business
in the door and to keep the business we already have.
 
THEIR LOCATIONS . . . .
 
The ACs and RCMs (Regional Consulting Managers) in thirteen field
offices are strategically located to provide local support to the
field sales force.  They also serve as contacts for clients who need
technical help.
 
THEIR FUNCTION . . . .
 
The function of the ACs has always been to provide presales and
postsales support and customer training, and to do small development
projects.  Within the new organization, ACs will continue to do all of
these things.  But they will be directing more of their efforts toward
presales support.  The hotline will take over some of their postsales
support duties, SDS will do more of the development work, and Terry
expects to see more of the training taken over by other ACS
organizations.  The ACs will then have more time for strategizing with
the sales people to sign new business.
 
CONSULTING SERVICES . . . .
 
The people in the Consulting Services group are the ACs' ACs.  Their
depth of experience enables them to help the ACs with the
opportunities that are larger and/or more technically complicated.
 
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT . . . .
 
To do their job, the Consulting Services people need to know where to
get answers to their own questions and those of the ACs, and they need
people in key areas who can answer their questions quickly.  That's
the function of the people in Program Management and Support.  Each
has an area of specific expertise that the Consulting Services people
may not necessarily have.  They provide program management support to
make sure we deliver what has been promised, can bill according to the
sales agreement, and can meet customer deadlines.
 
According to Terry, the IACS organization is positioned as the primary
ACS contact for all sales organizations, key customer accounts, and
other McDonnell Douglas business units.  On the average, each member
is responsible for more than $1 million in annual revenue.  "We intend
to invest in this group to accomplish our part in 'Building the
Vision'.  I believe we have the necessary critical mass, the right
people, and the management support", says Terry.

IACS will also act as a focal point for anyone who needs ACS
information or services.  If you don't know who to contact with your
technical or marketing questions, send an OnTyme to ACS.HELP.

To:          All ISG Employees (Including MDAIS)

Subject:     EXECUTIVE BRIEFING CENTER PHOTO EVENT



As many of you know, we are remodeling our St. Louis Executive 
Briefing Center in Bldg. 300.  The remodeled area will provide us 
with a facility in which we will be proud to host our customers 
and visitors.

Currently, the entrance to the area has a large display of 
photographs from the Missouri Botanical Garden, which were taken 
by Jack Jennings, Director of Sales in the Diversified Information 
Systems Company.  We think it would be fun to use photographs 
taken by other employees throughout the area.  If you are 
interested in having your work displayed, please submit your 
entries to Al Schikore, Dept. I018, Bldg. 301, Level 2W, Post A5, 
no later than 15 July 1985.  Photographs will be selected for 
display by a panel of distinguished ISG judges.  In order to be 
considered, entries must meet the following guidelines:

     -   All photos must be the original work and property of the
         submitting ISG employees or their families.

     -   Entries should be submitted as prints or slides along 
         with the name, address and title of the submitter as well 
         as a brief description of the subject.  (We will attempt 
         to return all materials submitted, but you should not 
         submit your only copy of a treasured photo or slide.)

If a photo is selected for exhibition, it will be enlarged (if 
appropriate), matted, framed and displayed in the area, with 
credit given to the artist.  As photos are rotated out of the 
exhibition, the artists will receive their photos, as they were 
displayed, for their own personal use.

I want to wish all entrants the best of luck.  I am really looking 
forward to seeing the results of the event.

To:          ISG Lists A-D

Subject:     INTERIM ORGANIZATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FINANCIAL 
             TRANSACTION SYSTEMS COMPANY




As you may recall, the Administrative Bulletin that announced the 
formation of the McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems 
Company (AB ISG-85-61, 3 May 1985) indicated that I would act as 
President of that organization until a permanent president is 
selected.  In the meantime, however, we have a lot of work to do.  
We must develop a business plan to introduce the new product lines 
recommended by the Strategic Task Force and agreed upon by the ISG 
Executive Board.  In addition, such opportunities as credit 
reporting and loan authorization demand further study.        

To ensure that this work continues to progress, I am announcing an 
interim organization that will permit us to function in an orderly 
manner until a new president is named and can participate in 
building a permanent organization.  Effective immediately, the 
following people report directly to me:

David Jung, as Vice President-Credit Reporting Development.  David 
was Tymshare's Vice President of Strategic Planning before 
becoming a member of the Financial Services Task Force.  He is 
responsible for the continued exploration of credit reporting and 
loan authorization opportunities.

John Mazzola, as Vice President-Check Card Development.  Before he 
became Chairman of the Financial Services Task Force, John was 
Director of Corporate Marketing in the former McAuto.  He assumes 
responsibility for planning and initiating developmental and pilot 
activities in those product lines approved by the Executive Board, 
including debit cards and electronic check-cashing cards.

Jeff Baer, as Executive Assistant to the President.  Under my 
direction,  Jeff will perform many of the tasks of a full-time 
president, given that I am involved in many other ISG activities.  
Jeff was most recently a member of the Strategic Task Force.  
Prior to that, he was a Tymshare Vice President, responsible for 
the Payment Services Company.








Alden Heintz will continue to report to me as President of 
McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company, the organization within 
the McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company that 
is doing all of our current business in this area.  Alden will be 
involved in deliberations on all major McDonnell Douglas Financial 
Transaction Systems Company issues, but his primary focus will be 
on the continued growth and profitability of our existing 
businesses.

We intend in the near future to have McDonnell Douglas Financial 
Transaction Systems Company fully operational, with an integrated 
organizational structure and multiple business lines.  In the 
meantime, please give your full support to David, John, Jeff and 
Alden, as they set out to shape ISG's future in the financial 
transaction systems marketplace.

Effective immediately, Dick Miskell, Director ISG Field 
Facilities, will report to me.  Dick formerly reported to 
Paul Wiedenmann, Corporate Vice President - ISG Finance.

The mission for the Field Facilities function, as set out in Ref 
(a), remains unchanged.  It includes a planned consolidation of 
selected field locations into shared ISG Business Centers.  A task 
force, headed by Dick Miskell, is developing a plan for 
implementing these centers at specific locations.  An Executive 
Steering Committee will review Task Team actions and recommend 
policy requirements.

Please give Dick your full support and cooperation.

Duuuh!  So that's what happened to my WF!  . . .  I guess I'm a creature of
habit, I'd forgotten all about NEEDWF!  Maybe I need a vacation.

Q:  Is there any problem with host 184 not having a SPOOL directory?  It
looks like they don't use SPOOL on that host, from what I've seen
tonight:  When I tried to TELECOPY to SPOOL:184, I got "no FD for
(SPOOL:184)."

Everybody, including 930 (but excluding 184 and the domestic 2020's) has
been given the new NODPRI.

SEE you tomorrow!

SUBJ:    SPOOL's node/printer map updated 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The file (SPOOL)NODPRI has been updated on all CEGI hosts, including 90
(except host 184, which does not have a SPOOL directory).  The update
was completed by 5 am, GMT, 25 Jun 85.  The association of node numbers
with printer locations is now consistent with the information currently
entered into the data base on host 8 by System's Resource Allocation.

The delay in responding to your request for this update was due to the
need to correct errors in the file and confirm the contained
information.  Procedures and policies are being established to effect
the updating on a monthly basis, so the current problem should not
re-occur.

I hope and believe that all is now correct.  If host 184 should have the
NODPRI file for SPOOL, please let me know where it should be.  If the
node to printer correspondence is in error, please let SRA and me know.

       MATERIALS AND LOGISTICS, MDFSC
 
SUBJ:  ORGANIZATION OF MDFSC 
       MATERIAL AND LOGISTICS DIVISION
 
 
*****************************************************************
 
 
After  a 2 day meeting with the major logistics functions of  the 

three  Field Service organizations,  Microdata,  Computer Systems 
and Support (CSS),  and Tymnet,  an organizational structure  was 

identified.   The  structure utilizes the best talents within the 
organizations and will focus on combining assets to integrate the 

operations and at the same time be transparent to our customers.
 
The results will offer greater capability to improve our  support 

of  the  new  Field  Operations Division and  for  the  McDonnell 
Douglas customer.  We feel confident that our abilities, combined 

with the assets available will help make us successful in support 
of our company's customer service effort.
 
With  quality  in  the main focus and with  the  best  individual 

effort  by  our  employees,  we will make  a  major  contribution 
towards  the  Field Service Company not only meeting it's  goals, 

but  exceeding  them.   Good performance will breed  success  and 
allow opportunity for growth to individuals who contribute  their 

best.
 
The  new  organization  was effective June 17,  1985  and  is  as 

follows.
 
Quality Control - Manager - Larry Keniston
------------------------------------------
 
Larry has been the Quality Control Manager at CSS Agoura for five 

years.    Prior  to  that,  Larry  was  either  in  manufacturing 
supervision  or in quality control with Douglas Manufacturing  or 

North  American  for  about  30  years.    Larry  brings   needed 
experience  to  MDFSC in all areas of quality  control  including 

complete  knowledge  of quality control as specified by the  U.S. 
Government.
 
Larry  will  relocate  to  the Field  Service  Depot  at  Irvine, 

California,  after the Agoura facility is relocated.  This should 
be  some  time in September of 1985.   As manager of our  quality 

control operations,  Larry will be responsible for inspection  of 
repair  and refurb work done in our depots.   Larry will  install 

procedures,  guidelines  and  systems that will  standardize  our 

Quality  Control  operations  at the existing depots in  King  of 
Prussia, Atlanta, Irvine, Fremont, and Chatsworth.
 
Please refer quality problems or questions to Larry.   Larry will 

be  working closely with the Material Support,  Test  Engineering 
and  Depot  Repair functions in our division to  deliver  quality 

spare parts.
 
Test Engineering - Manager - George Turner
------------------------------------------
 
George  has  been  the  Manager of Repair  and  Test  Support  at 

Microdata's  Field Service Depot  in  Irvine,  California,  since 
1979.   Prior to that,  George had a long career with the Navy in 

electronics  and  testing.   George  specializes  in  electronics 
testing  and automatic test engineering (ATE),  his strengths are 

in  the  use of analytical methods to define  problems  and  find 
solutions.
 
Under  George's  direction,  ATE standards and problems  will  be 

developed   and   ATE  hardware  will  be  deployed  to   enhance 
productivity and quality of repair in the repair depots.  Failure 

analysis will be a key responsibility to establish priorities  in 
attacking  failures in hardware serviced by our Field  Operations 

Divison.
 
Material Support - Director - Jerry Bowman
------------------------------------------
 
Jerry has been the Director of Logistics Operations at  Microdata 

since  1982.   Prior  to  that,  Jerry put together 22  years  of 
professional experience in logistics.  Jerry has spent 9 years in 

administration  and  management and 13 years  in  supervision  of 
various  logistics operations.   Jerry was previously employed by 

Tymshare  for  5  plus years and is familiar  with  the  Tymshare 
business and products prior to McDonnell Douglas.   Jerry will be 

responsible for integrating the material support functions of the 
three former organizations and their various  locations.   Please 

refer  any  material supply questions or needs to Jerry.   I  can 
assure you that Jerry will be more than happy to respond  quickly 

in the most professional manner as he has in support of Microdata.  
 
Depot Repair - Director - Virginia Buhr
---------------------------------------
 
Virginia  has  been the Director of Microdata's repair depots  in 

Irvine,  California,  and Atlanta,  Georgia.   Virginia has  been 
employed  by  Microdata  since 1976 and has  been  a  significant 

factor  in  the  high quality and quantity of parts  supplied  in 
support  of  the field operations  activity.   Virginia  will  be 

responsible  for  integrating  the  repair depots  of  the  three 
organizations along with their various locations.   In the  event 

that  McDonnell Douglas ventures into any 3rd Party Depot Repair, 
Virginia  will also support that activity.   I am sure all of  us 

are  looking  forward  to working with Virginia  and  her  proven 

ability to organize and work effectively with  people.   Virginia 
brings  20  plus  years of logistics support  experience  to  our 

division  which  provides a valuable source to draw from for  the 
challenges ahead.
 
Material and Logistics Planning - Manager - Anver Meghji
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Anver  has  been the Manager of Worldwide Parts for Tymnet  Field 

Engineering  and was first employed by Tymshare in  1973.   Anver 
has a successful track record in project management, implementing 

such projects as Dialnet,  Bofanet and Marsplus along with  video 
banking  development.   Anver  resides in the Bay Area  and  will 

remain here for the near term.  The first priority for Anver will 
be  to play the major role for our divison in project  monitoring 

and  system specification for the management systems that will be 
used  for our logistics efforts.   This is a major  effort  since 

none   of   the  three  organizations  have  systems   that   are 
integrateable.  Anver's business background and education will be 

a   great   asset  in  the  management  system  development   and 
implementation.
 
Chatsworth Depot - Manager - Jay Webb
-------------------------------------
 
Jay  Webb  has agreed to manage the depot and inventory  for  the 

Chatsworth,  California operations.   Jay has been involved  with 
management  of  the Chatsworth operation for over 10  years.   We 

intend to keep this operation separated from other operations  at 
this  time  as  it is a 3rd Party Service Depot for  very  mature 

Ampex and CalComp products.   Inventory sales and remanufacturing 
are  the  main focus of business with 50% of sales  to  the  U.S. 

Government  and 50% to the commercial markets.   The sales effort 
will remain with our sales division.   Jay will work closely with 

Sales to meet all delivery dates.  
 
I am sure that all of you,  like myself,  are looking forward  to 

the  integration  of the different organizations and the  various 
synergies.   There are great opportunities ahead for our division 

in  support of the various business units.   We feel we have  the 
ability  and  capacity to keep pace with  the  various  marketing 

efforts and support the Field Service needs of our customer base.  
The  combining of the different organizations make us one of  the 

largest field service organizations in operation.   A major focus 
is now upon us and we welcome the challenge.

     Subject:      ISG EXECUTIVE BOARD DECISION ON THE FIELD 
                   FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM




     The Executive Board has approved moving forward with Phase I of 
     the recommended plan for consolidation of selected field office 
     locations into shared ISG Business Centers.

     The initial metropolitan areas to be addressed in the plan 
     include New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San 
     Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Houston and Dallas.  These eight 
     areas represent over 50% of the annual ISG real estate lease 
     expense and personnel in field locations.

     A task force of real estate management representatives from five 
     ISG business organizations will team with Dick Miskell, Director 
     - ISG Field Facilities, to develop a specified detailed 
     implementation plan and schedule for each metropolitan area.  
     The actual consolidation process will be implemented over a 
     three year period and will involve other metropolitan areas.

     An executive level Steering Committee comprised of 
     representatives from six ISG organizations will be utilized to 
     review and recommend policy needs.  These policy recommendations 
     will support the implementation and remote office administration 
     needs of the shared ISG Business Centers.  Specific areas to be 
     addressed include the remote office administrative organization 
     structures, office standards and the tenant cost allocation 
     process for real estate lease expenses as well as common office 
     services and equipment in the shared environment.

     These new ISG Business Centers will increase McDonnell Douglas 
     visibility in the ISG major market places, optimize office 
     services through the larger shared office environment and obtain 
     maximum leverage in lease negotiations to reduce long-term real 
     estate lease expense.  Please give your support to the task 
     force over the next few months to expedite completion of this 
     task assignment by the Executive Board.

     Subject:    EXECUTIVE BRIEFING CENTER (GUEST SERVICES)


     Phase One of the renovation of the Executive Briefing Center 
     will be completed on July 10, 1985.  Construction will be moved 
     to the far end of the hall opposite the library allowing guest 
     events to proceed without the congestion of the last two months.

     Make an appointment for a tour before you plan to use the new 
     facility.  Some new features of the Executive Briefing Center 
     include indicator lights to signal when your refreshments are 
     ready, a new projection room equipped for 35MM slides and 
     movies, fixed and portable video projection systems, and 
     electronically controlled room lights, screens, and projectors.  
     We suggest you stop by for a briefing before your meeting 
     begins.

     For reservations in the new facility, call Ann Duenke at 
     (314) 233-5196 and tell her what type of meeting you will be 
     having.  We'll need to know how many people, A/V requirements, 
     demonstration  needs (if any), and whether it's a workshop, 
     presentation or training class.  We'll assign you a room 
     designed to meet your needs.

     The Executive Briefing Center staff is prepared to assist all 
     field marketing personnel with the preparations necessary to 
     make your next visit a marketing event.  Allow us to assist with 
     your plans for local transportation, lodging, and meeting 
     services.

     Guest Dining reopened on June 24, 1985 in a beautiful new 
     facility designed for breakfasts, lunches, receptions and 
     dinners for our guests.  It now has a warm atmosphere conducive 
     to business discussions.  Operating procedures have remained as 
     they were prior to renovation.

     We are open for business again and we look forward to seeing you 
     soon.

     I am pleased to announce the formation of an Export Compliance 
     Department for the Information Systems Group.  This department 
     will be responsible for estabishing and implementing export 
     policies, guidelines and training programs within ISG.  They will 
     also conduct field reviews required by Government agencies in 
     connection with our obtaining export licenses.


     Marilyn Loewy is hereby appointed Director Export Compliance 
     reporting to me.  In addition to responsibility for export 
     compliance this function will also support MDISI in areas of 
     international administration as required.


     Marilyn will continue to chair the ISG Import/Export Committee 
     comprised of business units licensing representatives.


     Current licensing activity at companies will remain decentralized, 
     leaving autonomy with licensing representatives at companies to 
     implement procedures and handle the day-to-day operations.  The 
     ISG Import/Export Committee will continue as a key mechanism for 
     communication throughout ISG.


     I am counting on your support for Marilyn and her staff in their 
     efforts to provide a practical, efficient and responsive framework 
     for coordinating ISG's activities in the vital areas of export 
     compliance and international administration.

Many reorganizational changes are continuing within MDC,
as you all are aware - (what are you called THIS week??)  

Due to 'continuing', as of today, July 8, a freeze has been
placed on all renames or consolidations of accounts.  This
should last until around September 1.  I'll keep you posted
if there is any modification to this date.  

Thanks for your ongoing support.

Pictures for McDonnell Douglas Badges are in the process of
being taken.  Each division will be notified the day before.

For best results it is good to wear color.  Pictures only
take a few moments of your time so when it comes your time
please be available.  Anyone that is out the specific day
of their divisions pictures due to illness or vacation is
requested to let the Security Dept. know when they are back.

All pictures for VG1-2-3 will be taken in the Cafeteria of
VG1.  All other locations will be notified at a later date.

Thank you.

Following is an updated listing of the phone numbers for 2450 N. 1st.
 
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE DIRECT DIAL ACCESS.
 
You must use a tieline to call direct to an extension or call the main
number (435-0200) and ask the receptionist to put your call through.
Attempting to dial direct on an outside line will only give you a busy
signal.
 
This updated list includes the current phone listing for DSC personnel
with offices in this building.
 
Thank you,
Anita

-----------------------------------------------------------------------








To  reflect the reorganization of the old McAuto Company, several new
Ontyme  Accounts  have been created and the MCAUTO Account has become
obsolete.  Four of the newest Ontyme Accounts are --

           ISGFM -- ISG Fiscal Management Division
           ISGHQ -- ISG Executive Management
           ISGHR -- ISG Human Resources Division
           MDAIS -- McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Information Systems

I  have  included  the  latest  Directories for these Ontyme Accounts
here.    If you have any questions or need assistance, please call me
at  (314) 233-5116, the ISG USC (User Support Center) or ONTYME me at
ISGFM.K/WADDELL.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
With the excessive amount of update requests that flow through my
office everyday, there has come a need for me to select a designated
day that all requests will be completed.

Starting next week 7/15/85 all requests* for public updates will
be completed on Monday afternoons.  This means if I receive your
request on Tuesday morning, there will be a maximum of five(5) working
days before the update will be available.  If, by some miracle I
can complete the request before Monday afternoon, it will be given
my full attention.  Please, don't expect this to be completed before
Monday.  But, as I said before ... Miracles do happen!

If you will need (emergencies) the update before Monday. It would be
most appreciated if you would call the day before:

With, 1) Letting me know it's on it's way.  and 2) The day you will
need it by.

This memo does not pertain to the updates I have in my office as of
today 7/9/85.  These requests will be completed by Friday, 7/12/85.

Thank you for all your support in the past and future.  


Now on with the showwwwwwwww.......!!

* Exception:  Emergency updates are not included in this statement.

SUBJECT>   Reorganizational Changes within MDC


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Many reorganizational changes are continuing within MDC,
as you all are aware - (what are you called THIS week??)  

Due to 'continuing', as of today, July 8, a freeze has been
placed on all renames or consolidations of accounts.  This
should last until around September 1.  I'll keep you posted
if there is any modification to this date.  

Thanks for your ongoing support.

Please send this message to all account supervisors.

From:  Linda Walker - Secretary, Security

To:    All Employees

Pictures for McDonnell Douglas Badges are in the process of
being taken.  Each division will be notified the day before.

For best results it is good to wear color.  Pictures only
take a few moments of your time so when it comes your time
please be available.  Anyone that is out the specific day
of their divisions pictures due to illness or vacation is
requested to let the Security Dept. know when they are back.

All pictures for VG1-2-3 will be taken in the Cafeteria of
VG1.  All other locations will be notified at a later date.

Thank you.

Following is an updated listing of the phone numbers for 2450 N. 1st.
 
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE DIRECT DIAL ACCESS.
 
You must use a tieline to call direct to an extension or call the main
number (435-0200) and ask the receptionist to put your call through.
Attempting to dial direct on an outside line will only give you a busy
signal.
 
This updated list includes the current phone listing for DSC personnel
with offices in this building.
 
Thank you,
Anita

-----------------------------------------------------------------------








To  reflect the reorganization of the old McAuto Company, several new
Ontyme  Accounts  have been created and the MCAUTO Account has become
obsolete.  Four of the newest Ontyme Accounts are --

           ISGFM -- ISG Fiscal Management Division
           ISGHQ -- ISG Executive Management
           ISGHR -- ISG Human Resources Division
           MDAIS -- McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Information Systems

I  have  included  the  latest  Directories for these Ontyme Accounts
here.    If you have any questions or need assistance, please call me
at  (314) 233-5116, the ISG USC (User Support Center) or ONTYME me at
ISGFM.K/WADDELL.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
With the excessive amount of update requests that flow through my
office everyday, there has come a need for me to select a designated
day that all requests will be completed.

Starting next week 7/15/85 all requests* for public updates will
be completed on Monday afternoons.  This means if I receive your
request on Tuesday morning, there will be a maximum of five(5) working
days before the update will be available.  If, by some miracle I
can complete the request before Monday afternoon, it will be given
my full attention.  Please, don't expect this to be completed before
Monday.  But, as I said before ... Miracles do happen!

If you will need (emergencies) the update before Monday. It would be
most appreciated if you would call the day before:

With, 1) Letting me know it's on it's way.  and 2) The day you will
need it by.

This memo does not pertain to the updates I have in my office as of
today 7/9/85.  These requests will be completed by Friday, 7/12/85.

Thank you for all your support in the past and future.  


Now on with the showwwwwwwww.......!!

* Exception:  Emergency updates are not included in this statement.

Chicago's recent ACS Seminar was a success, thanks to Jeff Lauer.
Jeff invited 14 attendees and identified four good prospects.
 
The schedule at press time is
 
          DATE             CITY             MANAGER
 
          August 22        Toronto          Phil Taylor

ACS Seminar coordinator Nancy Browning is exploring new ways of
helping the branches organize seminars.  She has asked other ISG sales
groups (for example, Manufacturing, MDCIS, and Banking) to invite
customers.
 
 
 . . . . . . . . . A NEW ACS STRATEGIC PLANNING GROUP . . . . . . . . .
 
Strategic Marketing Development (SMD), managed by Kathy Donigan, is an
exciting addition to ACS.  Kathy and key marketing and technical
people plan to suggest four to six new ACS products and services by
the end of the year.
 
"This year SMD plans to package capabilities that we are currently
using," reports Kathy.  "This means defining each product and its
customer base and preparing sales brochures and pricing schemes."
 
Kathy's SMD team identified two product sources:  TYMNET-based
products used by ACS clients, and successful integrated applications.
These integrated applications would be generalized from a particular
client to an entire industry.  The SMD team also pinpointed some
additional technologies needed by ACS development and will propose a
long-term plan.
 
Kathleen Farley, Lynne Edwards, Thomas Olt, and Bruce Watkins have
been appointed as SMD Product Managers.  Their first job is to develop
preliminary business plans for proposed products, and to determine
staffing needs.
 
 
 . . . . . . . . . . CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER NEWS . . . . . . . . . .
 
In early August, the Customer Service Center (CSC) will handle ACS
customer validations on the TYMCOM-370 and TYMCOM-X.  (Watch OnTyme
for details.)  CSC needs information for all customers entered into
the CSC customer profile data base by then.

Note to ACs and RCMs:  Please send your customer information to
CSC.HOTLINE.

Mainframe Product Support now supports mainframe AND micro products
and has a new name:  ACS Product Support.  This group now supports ACS
consultants, and CSC, and installs software, handles vendor relations,
and evaluates potential new software products.  ACS Product Support
personnel and their areas of responsiblity are:
 
    Terry Griffin           Manager
    Ron Bates               Micro products
    Dan Wedge               TYMCOM-370 and TYMCOM-X operating systems,

VALLEY FORGE DATA CENTER CLOSES . . . .
 
The Valley Forge Data Center recently closed, and ACS customers were
transferred onto two new IBM 3083s in Dallas.  "The 3083 is a more
cost-effective machine than the 3033 [which Valley Forge had], and has
a processing speed that provides almost twice the throughput," says
Terry.  "Everything that worked on the smaller machine works on the
3083, so the transfer is transparent to our customers."  The transfer
should result in over half a million dollars in savings for ISG this
year.
 
 
PC/FOCUS UPGRADED TO VERSION 1.5 . . . .
 
PC/FOCUS 1.5 has now been shipped to all customer sites and to branch

 . . . . . . . JULY PROFILE:  INTEGRATED SYSTEMS MARKETING . . . . . . .
 
Integrated Systems Marketing (ISM), promotes communications-based
systems that utilize multiple technologies.  It also offers mainframe
and micro-based tools for creating these systems.  Manager Scott
Holiman describes ISM's mandate:  ISM is to "make ACS the clear leader
in the delivery of integrated systems.
 
"There is a tremendous market for integrated systems," says Holiman.
"Our competitors are moving in this direction in a big way.  We have
the lead, but we must take advantage of our window of opportunity.
Our organization wants to support the sales force in exploiting that
lead."
 
ISM helps the branches identify new customers and develop sales
strategies.  It educates sales reps about integrated systems and
provides them with sales aids.  ISM also manages the ACS Customer
Service Center (CSC).
 
ACTIVITIES . . . .
 
The major ISM activity currently is The ACS Seminar, which explains to
potential customers the concept of integrated systems and describes
the successful Computerland application.  For more information on
seminar locations, times, invitations, and support, contact
ACS.N/BROWNING.
 
Other activities in the works include the release of a new version of
Tym/COMM in mid-September and brochures, data sheets, success stories,
and a sales kit.  If anyone knows of an integrated system that would
make a good success story, send an OnTyme to ACS.N/BROWNING.

15 July 1985
 
To:    MDC Employees Who Were Formerly Tymshare Employees
 
From:  C. H. Ridings
 
 
McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) has for many years 
supported charitable and community service activities 
through the MDC Employee Charity & Community Services (ECCS) 
program.  The primary source of the funds for the MDC ECCS 
program has been MDC employee contributions.
 
In the near future MDC employees who were formerly Tymshare 
employees will be contacted regarding their individual 
participation in the MDC ECCS program.  MDC ECCS uses 
employee contributions to support charitable and community 
services in the employee's local geographic area.
 
An example of local support is the following letter that I 
recently sent along with an MDC ECCS $1,000 contribution to 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Santa Clara County, 
Santa Clara, California:
 
     Ms. Nancy J. Wolff
     National Multiple Sclerosis Society
     Santa Clara County Chapter
     1765 Scott Boulevard, Suite 101
     Santa Clara, California 95050
 
     Dear Ms. Wolff:
 
     Pursuant to our telephone conversation of today, 
     McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) is pleased to 
     enclose MDC's Employee Charity & Community Services 
     check number 207302 totalling $l,000.
 
     The enclosed check is a contribution to the operating 
     funds of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Santa 
     Clara County, Santa Clara, California.  Please use the 
     contribution to continue the fine work your organiza
     tion is doing on a local and national basis.
 
     Please contact me at (408) 446-6405 if you have any 
     questions regarding the above.
 
 
Please be generous with your contributions when you are 
contacted for participation in the MDC ECCS program.

SUBJECT:  Fixed Asset Policies and Procedures
 
 
Following  is  a  brief summary of current Fixed  Asset  policies  and 
procedures  for McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems (headed 
by  Warren Prince) and specifically those locations whose  assets  are 
tracked  in  Cupertino,  CA.   Detail information can be found in  the 
Tymshare Policies and Procedures manual,  of which all managers should 
have a copy.   Current policies and procedures are being reviewed, and 
updated  versions will be released during the third quarter.   If  you 
have any questions, feel free to call me at (408) 446-6516.
 
1.   Capitalization Policy
 
     A.   The  requestor must complete the standard  Requisition  form 
          and the Authorization for Capital Expenditure (AFCE) for any 
          capital  item  of $1000 or more having a useful life  of  at 
          least  one  year.   This is an increase from the $400  limit 
          stated in the current Policies and Procedures manual.
 
     B.   When  determining  whether or not an item  meets  the  $1000 
          criteria,  you should take into account all elements of cost 
          including taxes,  freight,  installation costs and any other 
          charges incurred in preparing the item for service.
 
     C.   Completed  Requisition/AFCE packages should be submitted to: 
          McDonnell Douglas ISG, Fixed Asset Dept., 20705 Valley Green 
          Drive, Cupertino, CA  95014.
 
2.   Internal Transfer of Fixed Assets
 
     A.   A  new department is being established called Asset  Control 
          whose  responsibility  it will be to track the  movement  of 
          assets throughout the company.  The Asset Control department 
          must be notified of any physical movement of capital  assets 
          between cost centers and locations on an accurate and timely 
          basis.
     
     B.   Notification  must  be  made using the  Fixed  Asset  Change 
          Notice, a copy of which can be found in the current Policies 
          and  Procedures manual.   Completed forms should be sent  to 
          the attention of Peggy Bollinger at:  McDonnell Douglas ISG, 
          Asset Control Dept., 20705 Valley Green Drive, Cupertino, CA  
          95014.
 
     C.   Note:   Asset Control must also be notified when offices are 
          relocated.
 
3.   Lost or Stolen Assets 
 
     A.   Any  fixed assets which are lost or stolen must be  reported 
          to  the  Fixed Asset department for removal from  the  Fixed 
          Asset  System  (PIMS).   A  Lost  Equipment  Form  is  being 
          designed; in the meantime, please use the Fixed Asset Change 
          Notice discussed in the previous section.
 
     B.   Notification  of stolen assets must be accompanied by a copy 
          of the related police report.
 
     C.   Notification  should  be sent to:   McDonnell  Douglas  ISG, 
          Fixed Asset Dept.,  20705 Valley Green Drive,  Cupertino, CA  
          95014.
 
4.   Disposal of Fixed Assets
 
     A.   If  you have any equipment which you are no longer using  or 
          that needs to be disposed of,  contact Bobbie Hynes, Section 
          Manager of Equipment Disposition and  Sales,  at:  McDonnell 
          Douglas,  Equipment Disposition & Sales, 7300 Anacunda Ave., 
          Garden  Grove,  CA  92641 - phone:  (714) 952-6555.   Bobbie 
          will determine whether anyone else in the organization has a 
          use  for the equipment,  or will dispose of it for the  best 
          possible price.  You can also contact her if you are in need 
          of a particular piece of equipment.
 
5.   Fixed Asset Reports
 
     A.   Reports  are available from Fixed Assets per  your  request.  
          If  you  would  like  to receive a report or  be  put  on  a 
          distribution  list,  please  contact  Barbara  McIntyre  via 
          Ontyme  at  FIN.FIXEDASSETS.    Please  include  information 
          desired,  cost center(s), and the time period needed for the 
          report.
 
6.   Tagging New Assets
 
     A.   In  order to maintain and control accurate  asset  tracking 
          procedures,  it  is important that new capital equipment  be 
          tagged in an accurate and timely manner.
 
 
 
 
     B.   Only  equipment identified as capital (fixed) assets  should 
          be tagged.   Check the account number coding on the purchase 
          order  or requisition to make sure that the items have  been 
          approved as capital equipment.
 
     C.   Upon receipt,  place a tag on the equipment and fill out the 
          Asset  Control  Log.   The  Asset  Control  Logs  should  be 
          submitted  on  a  monthly  basis  to  Peggy  Bollinger   at: 
          McDonnell  Douglas ISG,  Asset Control Dept.,  20705  Valley 
          Green  Drive,  Cupertino,  CA  95014.   You can also contact 
          Peggy  at (408) 446-7760 if you have any questions  or  need 
          more tags.

SUBJECT:  ISG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
 
A number of changes to payroll input and personnel record keeping 
will be necessitated by the implementation of the ISG Benefit 
Plans on September 30, l985.  Some of these changes are:
 
   .  New payroll attendance reporting system utilizing new
      format of absence reporting for all employees.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled shift.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' schedule work
      week.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled hours.
      Note:  ISG full benefit eligibility is based on full time
      status (40 hrs/week).  Partial benefit eligibility is based 
      on part-time scheduled to work 20 - but less than
      40 hrs/wk.  Employees scheduled to work less than
      20 hrs/week are not eligible.
 
   .  Check stub will indicate the balance of vacation days
      remaining.
 
   .  There will be no borrowed vacation days under the ISG
      Benefit Plan.
 
Due to the above changes during the week of September 23, all 
managers will need to submit the following information for each 
of their employees via a prompt program:
 
  1)  Scheduled Shift
 
  2)  Scheduled Work Week
 
  3)  Scheduled Hours Per Week
 
  4)  Number of Vacation Days earned in 1985 which have been

TO:       ISG MANAGEMENT LEVELS A-H

SUBJECT:  ISG BENEFITS PACKAGE



1.  Distribution of the new ISG Benefits summary plan 
    descriptions is scheduled for Saturday, July 27, 1985.  As 
    managers you will receive the first packets.  This advance 
    copy will allow you to review the material prior to the 
    general employee mailing.

2.  Original plans called for you to receive your packets one 
    week prior to the mass distribution.  Due to printing delays 
    and the need to hold to the implementation date of 
    September 30, 1985, there will only be a two day difference 
    between packets mailed to management and those mailed to the 
    balance of employees.

3.  Enrollment meetings are scheduled at major business unit 
    locations throughout August.  A schedule of meeting dates 
    and sites is included with the packet.  Your support of 
    these enrollment sessions is critical to the success of the 
    program.

4.  Specific questions about the enrollment procedure or 
    benefits booklets can be referred to Karen Welch 
    (714) 250-1000 or Joe Hoffman (314) 232-8488.

1. This memo is a follow-up to the July 22 memo from Joe Walton, in
   which several ISG Benefit topics were introduced.
 
   * Scheduled Shift
     The PPSII (Payroll Personnel System) will require assigned shift
     for all employees in order to insure correct payment of shift    
     premium. The data collection system mentioned in the first memo
     will collect the assigned shift of all ISG Tymshare employees as
     of 09/30/85.  This will be done from 09/24 thru 09/27.
 
     After the benefit conversion (09/30/85) changes to assigned shift
     for more than 5 consecutive days must be reported to Cupertino
     Human Resources no later than the week in which the employee 
     changes shift, in order to assure accurate attendance processing.   
     Changes to assigned shift of less than 5 consecutive work days do 
     not require a change to the personnel system. 
 
 
   * Scheduled Work Week
     For proper attendance and absence reporting, a correct record of
     an employee's work week (scheduled days off) will be carried in the 
     PPSII system.  The general data collection (09/24 thru 09/27) will
     supply PPSII with the correct work week for each  employee as of 
     09/30/85. Thereafter changes to this assigned work week will need
     to be reported to Cupertino HR for update.
 
                                                                Page  2

   * Scheduled Working Hours
     For Part Time employees, an accurate record of work schedule will 
     be critical. Benefit eligibility will be determined based on
     scheduled hours per week.
 
   * Vacation records will be maintained in PPSII begining 09/30/85.
     This will require the number of vacation days taken by each 
     employee in 1985.  The amount of vacation accrued in 1985 (Jan.01
     thru Sept 30) will be calculated based on service date.  The 
     number of vacation days taken will be deducted from the 1985
     accrued time.  The figure that management will be asked to supply
     is the number of  vacation days each employee has taken in 1985 
     (Jan thru Sept) which were earned in 85.  Any vacation days taken
     against time earned in 1984 are not to be included.
 
   * No Borrowed Vacations
     The ISG vacation policy requires that vacation time be earned,  
     prior to being taken.  It is possible that under the present 
     Tymshare practice that by 09/30 an employee may have taken more
     days than have been earned to date, resulting in a negative value.
     This value will then be balanced out as an employee accrues  
     additional vacation days.
 
   * The procedures for vacation advances will be covered in a seperate
     memo.
 
2. In order to assist in the collection of the above information, you
   will be given a worksheet via the attendance system by Sept 6 with
   the names of all the employees assigned to your area.  This listing 
   will have space to fill in the requested data and can be used as an
   input sheet Sept 24 - 27, when inputing to the collection system.
 
3. Please direct your questions to the author via Ontyme to HRD.TOSH.

 . . . . . . . . AUGUST PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon that work together to provide the sales support materials
necessary to sell ACS products and services.  These units are
responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers)
* Marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets, and various
  other sales aids)
* Sales and customer training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Market research for product managers
* Building administration in VG-3.
 
During the past year, Shirley has worked with her section managers to
 
* Develop a better understanding of what training and support
  materials we can provide the sales force to help sell ACS products
* Develop effective public relations and advertising campaigns and
  materials, and marketing support materials such as data sheets,
  sales lists, and slide presentations
* Assign an "Opportunity Coordinator" to each product manager who
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 2
 
  requests Marketing Services' support.  The opportunity coordinator's
  responsibility is to monitor all aspects of the product manager's
  projects to ensure timely and high quality support.
* Create training, promotional, and technical materials "better,
  faster, cheaper"
 
This article profiles Marketing Publications, Production Services, and
Marketing Promotions.  Watch the September NEWSFLASH for information
on Training Services and Course Developments, Market Research, and
Administration.
 
MARKETING PUBLICATIONS . . . .
 
Marketing Publications produces a wide variety of written materials
for ACS.  According to Larry Tolbert, Marketing Publications Manager,
the group's task is to "make ACS products easier to understand and
use, and to assist in image-making and sales support for these
products."
 
Marketing Publications no longer produces only technical and training
manuals.  The group has taken an exciting new direction and now
provides a wide range of promotional materials, such as data sheets,
success stories, advertising copy, and scripted slide shows for sales
presentations.
 
For example, Marketing Publications recently completed six OnTyme
technical publications, ten data sheets, a case study for Forbes
magazine, and support materials for the ACS Seminar.  In September
they will release the Tym/COMM User's Guide, and in October three
stories for the ACS Success Story series.  They wrote Tym/COMM and ACS
Seminar ad copy for ISM.  And, they are working closely with Bill
Sarnoff to develop the ACS company brochure.
 
For a detailed list of publications produced by Marketing
Publications, see OnTyme Publications and ISM Publications in this
NEWSFLASH.  Or consult the OnTyme file *** ACS.PUBLICATIONS.

PRODUCTION SERVICES . . . .
 
Production Services, a subunit of Marketing Publications, provides
editing services, coordinates printing and production, and ensures
that ACS printed materials project a highly professional image to
customers and to other MDC groups.  Production Services supervisor Bob
Raymond joined the group on August 5.  He is a former Tymshare
employee and brings years of production expertise and knowledge back
to ACS.

MARKETING PROMOTIONS . . . .
 
Marketing Promotions Specialist Bill Sarnoff coordinates all
promotional activities for ACS.  Bill works closely with other
Marketing Services units to ensure that ACS publications project a
uniform image.  He also coordinates our advertising and public
relations activities.  He is currently working with the PR firm of
Dudly-Anderson-Yutzy (DAY) to present ACS products, services, and key
personalities to the business community through the trade press.  For
example, Bill is coordinating Phil Marson's upcoming PR tour.  He is
also working with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency of Chicago
on an ACS advertising campaign planned for January 1986.

     SUBJECT:      PROMOTION OF P. A. JELINSKI




     I am pleased to announce the promotion of Peter A. Jelinski to 
     the position of Director Business Management-Manufacturing and 
     Engineering Systems of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
     International (MDISI).  Peter will remain in The Hague and report 
     to me.

     He will have business management responsibility for international 
     sales of ISG manufacturing and engineering systems products.  
     Peter is well qualified for this position having had sales and 
     management experience in Europe since September 1982 when he 
     joined the Nordic office in Stockholm and then assumed 
     responsibility of General Manager for the Nordic operations in 
     February 1983.  In January 1984, he was promoted to European 
     Manager of CAD/CAM and moved to The Hague.

     Peter first joined MDC in July 1972 as a scientific programmer in 
     Huntington Beach.  He then joined Control Data Corporation in 
     January 1977 in Minneapolis where he was a unit manager for 
     software field support and later was promoted to senior 
     consultant for CDC computer systems marketing.  He rejoined 
     McAuto in June 1982 in St. Louis and moved to Stockholm in 
     September 1982.

     Born in London, Peter is an American citizen and attended schools 
     in Montreal and California.  He received a B.A. in mathematics 
     from California State University, Fullerton in 1971.  In 1972 he 
     was graduated with an M.S. in mathematics from the University of 
     London.

     Peter and his wife, Kerstin, are the parents of two children:  
     Rebecca, 2, and Christopher, who is 3 months old.  Peter attended 
     the ISG Marketing Achievement Club in 1984 in Jamaica.  He is a 
     member of the American Management Association.

     We are looking forward to receiving the benefits of Peter's 
     business management, insight and knowledge of planning and 
     contributing to the sales of ISG`s manufacturing, architectural, 
     engineering and construction products on an expanding scale 
     internationally in the near future.  Your cooperation with him in 
     achieving our greater goals will be greatly appreciated.

     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES (PLEASE POST)
 
   FROM:  STEPHEN REYNOLDS, MANAGEMENT TRAINING
          AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MT&PD)
 
SUBJECT:  NEW COURSE OFFERING --- "COUNSELOR SELLING SKILLS"
          
---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
The Wilson Learning "Counselor Selling Skills" program, used 
extensively by the McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, is now 
available to all ISG employees. 
                                                                         
Counselor Selling is a CUSTOMER focused program, rather than being 
product-focused like the Xerox-based programs.  It teaches how to 
build relationships with potential customers and how to achieve a 
MUTUALLY AGREED UPON UNDERSTANDING of their situation PRIOR to 
discussing the features and benefits of one's product(s).  It focuses 
on creating a "win-win" environment where the prospect WANTS TO BUY, 
rather than trying to "sell" the prospect.  Participants receive pre- 
and post-course feedback from potential and actual customers of their 
choice.
 
The seminar will be conducted by Randy Lipson, trainer for Bob 
Donoghue, Inc.  Randy has 23 years of sales experience and is former 
PSS-II & III trainer.  Employees' cost centers will be charged $710 
for their participation in this four day seminar.  This seminar is 
scheduled for the following dates: 
 
                 Oct. 21-24                  San Jose

---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
Given current initiatives to reduce costs within the ISG, a number of 
questions have been raised about programs conducted by MT&PD.  The 
following summarizes the status of these programs.
 
     1. All "Phase" programs in St. Louis scheduled between August 19 
        and December 31, 1985 have been cancelled.  A full schedule
        of Phase seminars is planned for 1986;  allocations for 1986 
        Phase slots will be made early in 4Q85.
 
     2. All San Jose MHP seminars will be held as scheduled, allowing 
        all Bay Area managers and supervisors to be trained by
        December, 1985.  The September MHP for New York has been 
        postponed until 1Q86.
 
     3. All other MT&PD programs will be held as scheduled, so long as 
        minimum enrollment requirements are met.  (A complete
        schedule is available on ONTYME; type :READ *** MTPD.SCHED)
        Enrollment in any MT&PD seminar (which includes a cost 
        recovery charge-back) requires written approval of your
        manager.  In some divisions additional levels of approval may 
        be required prior to confirmation of enrollment.
                                          
If you have any questions about MT&PD programs, please contact us at
408/446-7813, HRD.TRNG (ONTYME), or VG2-A04 (inter-office mail).

MEMO
 
T-RJF-009
 
TO:       The World
 
FROM:     Asset Control
 
SUBJECT:  Physical Inventory of Fixed Assets
 
As  announced previously via Ontyme,  McDonnell Douglas  Business 
and  Network  Systems will be conducting a physical inventory  of 
fixed  assets on October 1,  1985.   This inventory will  involve 
only  those  locations  whose assets are  tracked  in  Cupertino, 
California.   These  locations have cost center  numbers  between 
2000  and 6000;  those cost centers falling outside this range or 
which have alpha-numeric designations such as L475, etc. will not 
be included in this inventory.     
 
The purpose of this inventory is to insure that all fixed  assets 
are   recorded  at  their  proper  locations,   and  to  allocate 
depreciation expense correctly.   We must rely upon the personnel 
at  each  location  to  give us  the  most  accurate  information 
possible.
 
Inventory  packets  will  be sent to contact  personnel  at  each 
location  by  September 20,  1985.   These packets  will  include 
complete inventory instructions,  as well as a Physical Inventory 
Report listing all assets which the Cupertino Fixed Asset  System 
shows as being held at your location.  Additional asset tags have 
already been sent to those who have requested them.
 
You  will  be asked to (a) verify whether you do or do  not  have 
each  item on the Physical Inventory Report;  (b) tag and  record 
those assets which have not already been tagged;  (c) give us any 
information you can for those assets shown which you do not have; 
and  (d)  tag  and record any assets you may have which  are  not 
shown  on  the report.   Completed inventory packets  are  to  be 
returned the day following the inventory to:
 
McDonnell Douglas ISG
Asset Control Department
VG1-B12
20705 Valley Green Drive
Cupertino, California  95014
 
Only MDC-owned assets are to be included in the inventory; do not 
tag  items  which are on lease or loan from outside the  company.  
Also, all company-owned equipment located at employees homes must 
be brought in to your office location for tagging and recording.
 
 
 
 
 
Items to be inventoried and tagged are as follows:
 
A.   All  computer  equipment - CPU's,   memory,  disk  and  tape

Subject: 930 backups 


Since we are now without a COOP student to do the backups on system
930 we must have an alternative mechanism. After discussing with each
of you some suggested ways of handling the backups I am proposing
the following procedure in the interests of simplicity and reliability.
Each person in the list will have one day of the week assigned to
do incremental backups- this assignment will last "forever" and should
be easy to rememeber.  The monthly ALL FILES backup will rotate
across all memeb
across all members.

The winning assignments are:

Monday - Osman
Tuesday - Dan
Wednesday - Carl
Thursday - Joe
Friday - Bill

Monthly ALL FILES:

September - Dennis
October - Bill
November - Joe
December - Dan
January - Carl
February - Osman

See Osman if you have any questions about the procedure to follow.
Please do the incrementals at a regular time each day, say between
4 p.m. and 6 p.m.

If there are any problems with the assignments see me and we will
consider adjustments

These are tough times for all of us in ISG.  But, keeping it all 
in perspective, there are people in our communities who have it 
a lot tougher.

As you may know, McDonnell Douglas offers you an opportunity to 
help our less fortunate neighbors by means of two community 
services funds -- Employee Charity and Community Services (ECCS) 
and Personnel Community Services (PCS).  Your contribution to 
either fund is made through payroll deduction and the money 
stays within the community in which you live.  As a matter of 
fact, one in three of those who contribute will benefit directly 
from one of the many organizations supported by ECCS/PCS.

"I Care, I Share" is the theme of this year's ECCS/PCS 
me in mind when a company 
representative calls upon you.  Please show how much you care by 
sharing generously.

              VACATION SCHEDULING AND PAY ADVANCES
 
 
 
Effective September 30, l985, with the implementation of the ISG 
benefit package, earned vacation records for all ISG employees 
will be maintained in the MDC Payroll Personnel System (PPS II).
Once this is accomplished, advance pay for pre-scheduled vacations 
will be issued out of PPS II.
 
Requests for advance vacation pay will be as follows:
 
 1)  Vacation schedules are to be submitted via OnTyme message to 
     MDCHQ.PERSONNEL at least 2 weeks prior to the start of the
     vacation.
 
 2)  Requests should be made in the following format:
 
     Employee number, employee name (last, int.), first day of 
     vacation, number of vacation days
  
     Example:
 
     E.N.          NAME                   SCHEDULE 
 
     123456        Jones, J.          11/28/85 for 10 days
                                                                Page  2

 
 3)  For questions regarding vacation schedules and advances, call
     (314) 233-2974.
 
 4)  As a backup to the above OnTyme procedure, vacation schedules 
     can be called in to ISG Human Resources at (314) 232-7490.
 
 5)  It will be the responsibility of the office managers to 
     satisfy internal approvals before the schedule is transmitted 
     to PPS II for input.  This can be accomplished through the 
     use of MDC form #4006-2 which, when approved, would be 
     retained by department supervision.
 
 6)  Cancellations will be processed in the same manner.  Include 
     the same information along with the message "cancel 
     vacation".
 
 7)  Vacation advances will be made in 5 day increments only.
     NOTE: No vacation advance will be issued for schedules
           which include unearned and therefore borrowed days
           under the "Accelerated Vacation Policy". Vacations
           consisting partly or totaly of borrowed days will 
           not be pre-scheduled as outlined above rather they
           are to be reported throught the payroll attendance 
           system at the time the vacation is taken.
 
 8)  Vacation schedules for less than 5 days will not be advanced.  
     No schedule is to be reported to PPS II.  These days will be 
     reported through the weekly attendance collection system.
 
 9)  Vacation advance checks will be issued the Friday prior to 
     the first day of vacation.
 
10)  This procedure will become effective with vacations beginning
     on or after 10-14-85.  Approved vacation schedules for that 
     date or later should be submitted at your earliest       
     convenience to insure advance pay.
 
11)  Direct your questions to the writer via OnTyme HRD.TOSH.

1.  In addition to the information which you are being asked
    to supply Sept 24-26 regarding vacation days taken in 1985, 
    you will be asked to identify the number of days vacation
    taken between August 26 and September 29.  This information
    is needed to accurately comply with the requirements of the
    ISG Accelerated Vacation Policy.
 
2.  When logged into the Payroll Data Collection system September
    24, 25 or 26, you will first be prompted to input the number
    of vacation days taken in 1985 which were earned after
    January 1, 1985. (Vacation time taken against 1984 carryover is
    not to be included.)
 
3.  Next you will be asked to enter the number of vacation days 
    days taken since August 26, 1985 through September 29.  This
    number will be included in the total number entered above but
    needs to be recorded separately, in order to credit the five day
    vacation which a given employee may have taken prior to September
    30.  After September 29, vacation absences will be tracked in 
    PPS II.

SUBJECT:  ISG Real Estate Management Organization



I am pleased to announce the formation of the Real Estate 
Management organization within the previously announced 
Information Systems Group Facilities staff operation.

This group level organization will administer and coordinate ISG 
real estate lease functions with the exception of Tymnet node 
only locations and continue to implement the Field Facilities 
Consolidation Program.  Disk Miskell, Director - ISG Real Estate 
Management is responsible for this activity reporting to me.

Effective 01 October 1985, this new organization will provide 
services for new lease requirements while existing real estate 
organizations in Irvine and Cupertino, California will continue 
to support existing lease and accounting activities with the 
data processing systems in place.  A migration plan is being 
formulated to transfer relevant real estate lease information to 
St. Louis.  This plan will be communicated in a later 
Administrative Bulletin.

Your support of this new organization in performing ISG real 
estate functions and the on-going Field Facilities Consolidation 
Program will be appreciated.

The OnTyme Account, CPC, Commercial Processing Center, will be 
renamed this Saturday, 9-14, to IPC, Information Processing 
Center.  What does this mean to you??  Please take special note 
of the following:
 
     *  The only change involved in this rename is a change in 
the account code, from CPC to IPC.  The usernames (after the 
period), will not alter.  For instance:
 
          Bev Martin, (also CPC.SUP), has a personal userid, 
          CPC.B/MARTIN.  Only her account code is changing, the 
          username remains the same.  Starting Monday, her new 
          userid is IPC.B/MARTIN.  All other CPC userids are 
          affected in the same manner.
          
     *  Withhold any messages you wish to send to any CPC users 
from Thursday 1700 PDT (9-12) until Sunday 1700 PDT (9-15).  Send 
these messages Monday (9-16) to the new IPC userid.
 
     *  If you have any distribution lists which currently 
include CPC userids, remember to change CPC to IPC.
 
     *  If you wish to verify a userid, read *** DIRECT.IPC for 
an entire listing of userids under IPC.

Due to Colman Jung's departure, LOGINN and OPER passwords have been
changed for usernames that he used.  Those affected are:

LOGINN only:	TUCOOP & SPPOPER

LOGINN & OPER:	SYSMAINT

If you wish to know the new passwords, please ask me.  (I'm just
reluctant to put them in writing, in this memo.)

If any of you knows of an OPER password for usernames TSUCOOP or
SPPOPER, please let me know -- I believe they may have have existed, but
I don't know them.  Let me know them:  I'll make them consistent with
the LOGINN passwords.  This would be particularly valuable for username
SPPOPER, which often uses license.

Subject: OPER password on TYMCOM-X 

Your OPER password was found in a text file on your directory that
anyone could read (i.e. it wasn't encrypted).  It is NOT a good
practice to leave that information around where others can get it.

Also, it is not a good idea to put it into command files such as
(BAIGENT:33)INIT.CMD which any "snoopy" person can find it.

I changed it to something less creative.  Please do not have your
INIT program set license in the future.  The only programs that should
set license should be OPER and SETE!  Thank you....  see me to get
your new password... or have Jon login to system 34 and setup another
one (if you need it sooner).

PS. the only reason I found all this was that you wanted your home
system changed and I tried it out.. and got 33 the first time.

I seem to be unable to log into any system except 2096, 33 and 930
(I get "access not permitted" for all others).  You did'nt happen to
make a minor error when you changed my home system, did you?  I have
taken out my password from the INIT.CMD file on 930 and would like to 
copy it to all my other directories, if I can ever get back into
them.  Please take care of this ASAP!
thank you...Dan.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . ACS SEMINAR NEWS . . . . . . . . . . . . .
 
The ACS Seminar is proving to be an effective way to guarantee ACS
leads.  St. Louis Diversified Sales representatives put together an
extensive prospect list with the assistance of ISM, mailed 300
invitations, did phone follow up on the majority of prospects,
confirmed 38 attendees, and identified seven solid leads, two of which
could close and bill by year-end.
 
"The credit really goes to Hank Spencer and his fellow sales reps,"
says Nancy Browning.
 
According to Hank, representatives from 18 different St. Louis
companies attended the seminar.  "The seminar solidified relationships
with two current prospects, both of which will be proceeding with
pilot programs."  Five other opportunities were "uncovered."
 
Hank thanks the "ACS organization, and especially St. Louis consultant
Carol Burkett and Houston consultant D'Juanna Beer, who did an
outstanding job in their presentations and demonstrations of ACS
products."
 
San Francisco just completed its seminar with similar results.
 
Says Nancy, "If you commit yourself and follow up, you'll get a
handsome payoff."  At press time, the schedule for future seminars is

Browning, this can be an effective sales aid.  If you would like to

Tym/COMM Version 3.0 is now available - software and documentation.
Foreshadowing the product release has been heavy coverage by the trade
journals:  Communications Week (8/26), MIS Week (8/21), and
Information WEEK (8/12).  An ad for the product appeared in PC Week
(8/21).

before)" is a major selling point.
 
ISSCO SLIDE SHOW . . . .
 
ISSCO Visual Information Systems Software (our graphics vendor) has
put together a very nice slide show that starts out talking about the
Wharton Study that proved how much visuals help your presentations,
making meetings shorter and more productive.  The show then goes on to
explain all of ISSCO's products, with some fantastic examples of the
things you can do with graphics!

 . . . . . . . . . . NEWS FROM ACS FEDERAL PROGRAMS . . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Federal Programs expanded OnTyme and installed a local area
network (LAN) communications interface for the Army Corps of
Engineers.  "The number of Army Corps of Engineers staff using OnTyme
will increase from 2,000 to 10,000 in the next two months as a result
of a new contract," reports Russ Service, Manager of ACS Federal
Programs.
 
The Federal Programs organization markets ACS systems to the U. S.
Government here and abroad, and provides a 22-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week
hotline service to federal users.  In addition, the organization
provides pre- and post-sales technical support to commercial ACS
accounts in the Washington, DC area.
 
OnTyme training is one of the organization's strengths.  Using their
own hands-on training program, the Federal Programs staff has trained
1200 federal users of OnTyme worldwide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 4
 
Federal Programs also provides ongoing support for Army Corps of
Engineers applications installed on the Tymcomm 370.  These
applications are accessed by users in the U. S., Europe, Korea, Japan,
Philippines, Panama, and other international locations.
 
Currently Russ's organization is installing micro engines at Army
Corps of Engineers sites in Washington, DC and Germany to interface
LANs with TYMNET.
 
If you have questions about federal contract procedures or want to
exchange information about LAN communications interfaces, contact Russ
Service at ACS.GOVMAIL.
 
 
 . . . . SEPTEMBER PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES, PART II . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon.  These units are responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers) and marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets,
  and various other sales aids)
* Sales and training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Building administration in VG-3
 
Last month's Newsflash profiled Marketing Publications, Production
Services, and Marketing Promotions.  This month, we focus on Training
Services, Building Administration, and Course Development.  These
three units are responsible for
 
* sales and professional development training and course development
* building administration in ACS headquarters
 
TRAINING SERVICES . . . .
 
At first, Training Services might sound quite a bit like Course
Development -- until you look at the primary purposes of the two.
Course Development develops; Training Services administers.  Carlota
Santa Cruz, Manager of Training Services, sees the function of the
department more as the developer of a career training path rather than
particular technical courses.  Training Services programs include
 
- ACS Product School
- AC Exchange Week
- Presentation Skills
- Selling ACS Workshop
 
The courses that happen to lie along this path can come from a variety
of sources - Deltak, Xerox, internal development, or other sources.
 
To develop career training paths, Carlota evaluates all the available
courses and arranges them into a logical sequence.  When holes appear
in this sequence either she or Course Developer Sarah Chamlee Kinkel
develop the needed material.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 5
 
Valerie Minder, Training Support Specialist, has just begun to
facilitate the FOCUS Data Base Management class.  Additionally, she
checks for proper registration forms and tracks each student along the
proper training paths.
 
Training Services usually doesn't deal with technological concepts.
Training Services emphasizes the "how to sell" aspect of education;
for example, the "How to Sell ACS Products" Seminar deals primarily
with the consultative sale rather than the product sale.
 
The future should see more regional training schedules, including
workshops, facilitated by Carlota and Valerie or by ACS employees
trained in course facilitation by Carlota and Valerie.  For the
present, the training schedule is available on *** ACS.TRAININGSCHED.
Descriptions of the available courses are referenced from that file.
 
COURSE DEVELOPMENT . . . .
 
Course Development, in the words of Course Developer Sarah Chamlee
Kinkel, is responsible for developing courses not already covered by
Training Services or other packaged sources.
 
Course Development projects come from various sources:  ACS
consultants, product managers, or the training group itself.  Two
current projects originated with Terry Fujimoto and Shirley Macemon -
a Data Communications course called Bisynchronous Connections to the
Network, section one of four that will be delivered under the title
ACS Technologies Solutions Training.
 
Sarah manages the development projects from inception to completion.
This includes developing objectives, mustering resources to provide
technical input, writing handout and support materials, training
initial facilitators, and distributing packaged materials.
 
BUILDING ADMINISTRATION . . . .
 
A pleasant environment to do your work in is mandatory if you expect
to do good work.  Lighting has to be adequate, heating/air
conditioning has to work properly, telephones have to ring when
they're supposed to, and hardwires need to connect to the correct
equipment.  Even the colors need to soothe.  All of these working
condition concerns are in the care of Diane Gordon.
 
Her position as Building Administrator put her in the critical role of
supporting ACS while it supports you:  with security services,
maintenance, telecommunications, space planning, and construction.
Primarily, in her words, her job is to make sure ACS "gets its needed
services easily and quickly."

SUBJECT:  VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT FOR NORTHERN 
          CALIFORNIA



1.  In connection with the establishment of the Northern 
    California Metropolitan Services Organization, the question 
    of voice and data communications support to our Northern 
    California facilities was addressed.  It was decided that 
    voice and data communications support should be provided by 
    Tymnet Operations.

2.  The McDonnell Douglas Information Processing Company (MDIPC) 
    Telecommunications Services Organization, under the 
    leadership of M. Jack Daley, has been providing 
    communications support to Northern California organizations 
    as well as other ISG groups.  We want this group to continue 
    the fine work they have been doing.

3.  Effective immediately, Jack Daley and his organization is 
    hereby transferred from MDIPC to McDonnell Douglas Business 
    and Network Systems Company, Tymnet Operations.  Bob Tomasi, 
    Vice President, Tymnet Operations, will determine the 
    appropriate organizational placement within Tymnet 
    Operations.

1.  MDC Standards, Ref (a), provides a list of preferred 
    hardware and software standards for office automation.  For 
    ISG use, we are continuing with only the IBM Personal 
    Computer and IBM Personal Computer XT devices for automated 
    office systems.  Encl (1) provides the current standard 
    configurations for these systems.

2.  IBM Displaywriter has been removed from the standard.  The 
    IBM PC and IBM PC/XT with MultiMate are the standard systems 
    for word processing.  User Support Centers will provide 
    support for all installed Wang and Displaywriter systems, 
    but expansion of these systems, which require procurement of 
    hardware or software, is not authorized.

3.  Configurations in Encl (1) were modified to add Lotus 1-2-3 
    productivity aids, high speed hard disk backup capability 
    and graphics software.

4.  The User Support Centers are available to provide 
    information and assistance for configurations and ordering.

SUBJECT>   NEW PROCEDURES - CHANGES TO HRD ONTYME FILES


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Due to the Benefit Conversion and the new Payroll Attendance 
System, Human Resources has found it necessary to make some
changes to the *** HRD exec files on Ontyme.  The ONTYME 
programs will be revised effective September 30. All prior formats
after that date cannot be accepted, due to these changes.
 
 *  NEW HIRES, REHIRES AND CHANGES FROM TEMP TO PERM
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.NEWEMPLOYEE
 
We have added scheduled shift, hours and work week.  These items must be
entered for all employees. For part time employees also note that 
weekly/annual base pay is to be calculated on a 40 hour work week.  
All appropriate paperwork must continue to be sent to Human Resources and
your Personnel Coordinator if applicable.
 
Assigned shift times are as follows:
     
 1st Shift:  If start time is between  4:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon
 2nd Shift:  If start time is between 12:00 noon and  8:00 p.m.
 3rd Shift:  If start time is between  8:00 p.m. and  4:00 a.m.
 
 *  TERMINATIONS
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.TERMINATION
                                                                Page  2

 
Since vacation time will be tracked on PPS II we have deleted accrued
and carryover vacation from this exec.
 
 
 *  JOB STATUS AND PERSONAL STATUS CHANGES
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.CHANGES
 
This  exec has been added to,  due to the benefit  changes.   Use 
this exec to report and change to scheduled shift, scheduled work
week (days off), or scheduled work hours.  A memo from Dan Tosh
dated  Aug  15 is attached,  that clearly defines  these  fields. 
  
Leaves of abscences will also be reported on this exec, for all
absences  more than 5 consecutive days,  employees must be placed 
on leave.  All leaves must include the type of leave and the
projected date of return.
 
If you have any questions or problems you may contact me at
408/446-7756 or via ONTYME at HRD.PERSONNEL 
 
 
 
 
PLEASE NOTE: THESE CHANGES WILL BE SEEN ON THESE FILES MONDAY,
             SEPTEMBER 30.

SUBJECT>   ISG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. This memo is a follow-up to the July 22 memo from Joe Walton, in
   which several ISG Benefit topics were introduced.
 
   * Scheduled Shift
     The PPSII (Payroll Personnel System) will require assigned shift
     for all employees in order to insure correct payment of shift    
     premium. The data collection system mentioned in the first memo
     will collect the assigned shift of all ISG Tymshare employees as
                                                                Page  3

     of 09/30/85.  This will be done from 09/24 thru 09/27.
 
     After the benefit conversion (09/30/85) changes to assigned shift
     for more than 5 consecutive days must be reported to Cupertino
     Human Resources no later than the week in which the employee 
     changes shift, in order to assure accurate attendance processing.   
     Changes to assigned shift of less than 5 consecutive work days do 
     not require a change to the personnel system. 
 
  
   * Scheduled Work Week
     For proper attendance and absence reporting, a correct record of
     an employee's work week (scheduled days off) will be carried in the 
     PPSII system.  The general data collection (09/24 thru 09/27) will
     supply PPSII with the correct work week for each  employee as of 
     09/30/85. Thereafter changes to this assigned work week will need
     to be reported to Cupertino HR for update.
 
 
   * Scheduled Working Hours
     For Part Time employees, an accurate record of work schedule will 
     be critical. Benefit eligibility will be determined based on
     scheduled hours per week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
DUE TO SOME CONFUSION LATELY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES WE FOLLOW AT
THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER REGARDING CORPORATE ARCHIVES, I AM 
SENDING THE ONTYME TO CARIFY THE SITUATION.
 
1.  ANY ARCHIVE SENT TO THE ZANKER ROAD DISTRIBUTION CENTER FOR 
    STORAGE SHOULD BE IN STANDARD ARCHIVE BOXES, AND SHOULD
    BE MARKED CLEARLY ON THE FRONT PANEL WITH ALL THE NECESSARY
    INFORMATION:
 
    A.  DEPARTMENT WHO IS STORING ARCHIVE
    B.  CONTENTS OF ARCHIVE
    C.  DATE SENT OVER
    D.  DESTRUCTION DATE
 
2.  WE WILL THEN STORE THE ARCHIVE IN ANY AVAILABLE SPACE THAT WE
    HAVE WITHIN THE TWO DESIGNATED PALLET ROWS.
 
3.  IF YOU REQUIRE A CERTAIN ARCHIVE TO BE SENT TO YOU PLEASE CALL
    STEPHANIE AT 942-5330 AND GIVE HER ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION.
    SHE WILL THEN RELAY THIS INFORMATION TO OUR ARCHIVE CLERK,
    JOHN HEZLITT, WHO WILL SEARCH FOR THE ARCHIVE YOU NEED.
 
4.  STEPHANIE WILL CALL YOU BACK WITHIN 24 HOURS TO NOTIFY YOU OF
    EITHER 1) WHEN & HOW THE ARCHIVE WAS SHIPPED TO YOU OR 2) OF
    OUR INABILITY TO FIND THE SPECIFIED ARCHIVE.
 
5.  IF WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE REQUIRED ARCHIVE, YOU WILL
    NEED TO COME DOWN TO THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND LOOK YOURSELF
    WITH THE HELP OF JOHN HEZLITT, OUR ARCHIVE CLERK.
 
6.  IF YOU NEED TO COME TO OUR FACILITY TO LOOK THROUGH ANY ARCHIVES,
    AGAIN PLEASE ASK STEPHANIE AND ARRANGE FOR A TIME THAT YOU CAN COME 
    DOWN.  JOHN WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU IN ANY WAY NECESSARY AT THIS
    TIME.

Dan,
     I spend most of my life on the 10's these days.  We do most of
our work on 35 with a small portion on sytem 8..can u beleive that?
Any tips you have will be muchly appreciated. I am valid on several
systems but rarely have time to check for mail.  I do most of my
mail work via ontyme.  
     Why r u using COBOL as opposed to magnum?  I thought you were
the magnum king.  It sounds like your job is pretty secure?  I am
keeping my fingers crossed for everyone.  
     How is Jill?  I guess you are pretty excited about the house?
Someday I may own one myself. 
     Spoke for a long time with Carol Wickham the other day.  She trapped
me in the parking lot.
     WELL, good luck...Let me hear from you....

(despite the "recession") and the little snot is now making more
than I am.  We should move into the new house around the 12th of
Oct...can't wait!  If you're ever in the neighborhood (White and
Aborn roads in San Jose) come by and say HI!!

I'm programming in COBOL because MAGNUM is a dying horse.  In
January the MAGNUM support staff had 15 people in it, now I don't\
thin there IS a MAGNUM support staff!  Besides, MICOMS is an IDMS
application that runs in the 370's and they dont have MAGNUM.
I am also still involved in Tymcomm-X support, hence my knowlege
of the 10's.

Speaking of which, if you do any text editing on the 10's, please
(for YOUR sake) don't use EDITOR!  There is a wonderful screen
editor called PEAK that (once you get the hang of it) makes EDITOR
look like something from the dark ages.  Let me know if you want
more information on PEAK.  Also, for formal reports and stuff where
you want margins to line up, etc. there is a really nifty text
processor called RUNOFF.  It doesnt require any special CRT's or
printers and it will format you a really nice-looking report.

If you do alot of interhost copying (TELECOPY), there is a special
TELECOPY driving program called COPY that lives in the SPL
(Special Program Library) directory.  It allows one or more
files to be copied to one or more systems from a detached frame
so you can do other stuff while its running.  (This requires
that you have RF and WF license set I think).  There are probably
a whole lot of other little things that might be of help to you,
depending on what sort of things you do every day.

You know how the 940's have neat little INIT files that automatically
issue commands when you first log in?  Well, on the 10's you can only
initialize a PROGRAM, not a file.  Well, I wrote a program that will
read a file called INIT.CMD (in the directory you're logged into or
GFD'ed to) and stuff the contents of the file into the type-ahead
buffer as if they had been typed by the user.  Hence, you basically
get to initialize commands to run when you login (like SYSN or DAY
or MAIL or whatever).  Let me know if any of these things sound
like they might be useful to you.

Well...gotta go!  WBS (write back soon!)
...Dan

P.S.  Oh, by the way, how's ol' Wickham doing?  What about her daughter?

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 20 Sep 85



To:       All ISG Employees

Subject:  ISG EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT



Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and 
value to ISG by participating in approved educational programs, 
whereby the costs of the educational program are refunded to the 
employee to the extent specified in this policy.

This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of 
ISG employing companies as designated by the ISG Management 
Committee.

Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into 
two (2) categories as follows:

1.  Adult Education Program

    The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees 
    participating in non-credit courses designed to develop 
    potential capabilities.  The Adult Education Program 
    consists of the following:

    - High school equivalency preparation
    - High school diploma
    - Remedial education
    - Job related vocational courses

2.  College Study Program

    A program which falls into one of the following categories:

          Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
          is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
          his/her current position and/or increase the 
          employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
          position within ISG organizations.

          Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
          graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
          university which is related to the employee's 
          profession or other business related professions which 
          the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
          organizations.



Eligibility

    To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an 
    employee must be a full-time regular employee at the time of 
    enrollment and at the time the course is successfully 
    completed.  In addition, the employee must be in an active 
    pay status at the time of course completion and must not be 
    on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or 
    enter active United States military service after 
    enrollment, but prior to course completion, may be eligible 
    for reimbursement, provided all other requirements have been 
    met.

    The course or program must be conducted by an approved 
    and/or accredited educational institution.

    Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive 
    approval by employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by 
    their local Human Resources organization prior to the start 
    of the course.

    An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through 
    veterans' benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such 
    programs after reporting such eligibility, may be eligible 
    for that portion not covered as specified in this policy.

Enrollment

    Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two 
    (2) courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

    ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this 
    plan any educational institution.

Reimbursement

    Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a 
    minimum grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the 
    school requirements for degree objective), 80% of tuition, 
    enrollment fees, textbooks, required instructional material, 
    laboratory, and other recurring fees will be reimbursed.  
    Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not 
    reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F 
    scale.  In Adult education programs which are graded "A" 
    thru "F", the "C" grade rule applies for eligibility for 
    reimbursement.  Other evidences of satisfactory completion, 
    such as diplomas, certificates or letters from the 
    institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

    Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 
    and presentation of evidence of course/program completion, 
    grades and receipts are required.



Reimbursement  (Continued)

    The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It 
    may be terminated or modified at any time without prior 
    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

Subject:  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION NATIONAL CAR RENTAL 
          CORPORATE-WIDE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

To:       McDonnell Douglas Corporation Plant Lists A-H; Post 
          Bulletin Boards



1.  McDonnell Douglas Corporation has again signed an exclusive 
    supplier agreement with National Car Rental system, Inc. 
    beginning 01 October 1985 through 30 September 1986.  This 
    agreement replaces the previous National contract which 
    expires on 30 September 1985.  National Car Rental is to be 
    used by all reservation functions and by any individual MDC 
    traveler on company business with or without advance 
    reservations.  All car rentals should be made through 
    National, even for the few locations which have no National 
    services (since National will reimburse the rate 
    differences).  MCAIR Travel Services in St. Louis has been 
    assigned responsibility by MDC Corporate Office to 
    administer this agreement for all MDC locations.

2.  With the new agreement, unlimited mileage daily rates for 
    compact size vehicles ("B" size) returned to the same rental 
    location range for $26.00/day in St. Louis, Los Angeles, 
    Phoenix and Long Beach to $27.00/day throughout the 
    remainder of the United States.  Domestic weekly rates are 
    five times the daily rate and monthly rates are three times 
    the weekly rate.  The agreement also provides for Canadian 
    and international discounts.  One-way rentals are charged a 
    reduced time and mileage rate.  National should be notified 
    of the one-way rental at the time of reservation booking to 
    prevent a drop charge.

3.  The same Corporate rates have again been extended to MDC 
    employees for personal travel.  To obtain the Corporate rate 
    for personal rentals, employees should identify themselves 
    as MDC employees when they call National Car Rental at 
    1-800-328-4567 for their reservation.  The Human Resources 
    Office and Recreation Department have National Car 
    Identification cards which should be used with the 
    employees' MDC badges to obtain the MDC rate for personal 
    travel.

4.  All Corporate and personal domestic rentals include full 
    insurance coverage [Collision Damage Waiver, (CDW)].  
    International rates do not include insurance and must be 
    obtained at the time of rental.  On personal rentals, for 
    insurance coverage beyond the free CDW, any necessary 
    personal credit reference and driver's license requirements 
    remain the responsibility of the employee.



5.  If National Car Rental fails to provide a vehicle that has 
    been confirmed within 45 minutes after the traveler arrives 
    at their counter, a written notice along with a copy of the 
    car rental agreement should be sent to MCAIR Travel 
    Services, Dept. 028, Bldg. 275, in St. Louis.  The delay 
    will result in a $25.00 credit rental certificate.  If 
    National fails to comply with the preceding within one (1) 
    hour of the employees' arrival at the rental counter, 
    National will be responsible for a $100.00 penalty.  All 
    penalty certificates are payable to MDC, and will be used to 
    reduce the applicable component's monthly car rental cost.

6.  Where possible, the MDC Huntington Beach, Long Beach or 
    St. Louis Travel Departments should be utilized for making 
    business trip car rental reservations.  MDC receives a 
    commission on any car reservations made through these 
    departments which will help to hold down the Corporation's 
    ever-increasing travel expenditures.

7.  Please route this AB to all personnel in your organization 
    to notify travelers or reservation functions prior to 
    01 October 1985.  Any questions on this agreement should be 
    referred to Travel Services at 314/234-6666 in St. Louis; 
    714/896-2872 in Huntington Beach and 213/593-7565 in Long 
    Beach.

Subject:  Five Keys to Self Renewal; Special Assignment - 
          J. H. MacDonald



1.  Over the past four years, we have introduced the Five Keys 
    to Self Renewal; Strategic Management, Participative 
    Management, Human Resource Management, Productivity 
    Improvement and Ethical Decision Making.  Each of these 
    initiatives are interrelated and are necessary at MDC to 
    improve our competitive business position and ensure our 
    long-term survival.  It's our assessment that we are well 
    into what might be called the "awareness-informational- 
    experimental" phase of these Five Keys.  The big task ahead 
    of us is to guarantee that the Keys become fully implemented 
    and integrated into each of our jobs.  The Keys can't be 
    something we do in addition to our daily jobs but instead 
    must be literally built into the way we each carry out our 
    work.

2.  Because of the importance we place on this, we have asked 
    Jim MacDonald, Corporate Vice President - Human Resources, 
    to spend 90% of his time and effort over the next year on 
    ensuring that the Five Keys become fully implemented and 
    integrated into every function throughout the Corporation as 
    announced separately in Administrative Bulletin 85-74.

3.  The two of us will also be giving this Five Keys activity a 
    great deal of personal management direction.

Subject:  NEW DIRECTOR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PLANNING



I am pleased to announce that Kevin P. McKeon has joined the 
MDISI organization as Director Business Management Planning 
effective 7 October 1985 reporting to me.

Kevin's twelve years of successful sales, marketing and 
management experience began in 1973 with the Burroughs 
Corporation where he advanced from Sales Representative to Sales 
Manager and Sales Instructor.  He joined Tymshare in 1978 to 
establish the new office in Minneapolis and later he became 
Branch Manager in St. Louis.

In 1982, Kevin was selected as the Manager of Electronic Data 
Interchange and was responsible for the basic development of EDI 
as a business opportunity for Tymshare.  His most recent 
position was that of Tactical Marketing Manager for the EDI 
product in the McDonnell Douglas Electronic Data Interchange 
Systems Company.

Kevin's responsibilities in this position will focus primarily 
on strategic planning and marketing issues for the MDISI 
business unit.  In this role he will be instrumental in the 
maturation of MDISI into a marketing driven organization.

Please join me in welcoming Kevin to MDISI and in assisting him 
in the fulfillment of his new responsibilities.

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.

ISG-85-162
Page 2


    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will continue to take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.


ISG-85-162
Page 3


Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

To:       ISG Employees Eligible for Benefits

Subject:  ISG OPTIONAL SPECIAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE PLAN



During the month of November 1985 eligible employees who are not 
now members may elect to enroll in the Optional Special Accident 
Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

To:       ISG Employees Eligible for Benefits

Subject:  ISG OPTIONAL SPECIAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE PLAN



During the month of November 1985 eligible employees who are not 
now members may elect to enroll in the Optional Special Accident 
Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

    $ 75,000                 $ .68             $1.02
    $100,000                 $ .90             $1.36

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Richard C. Gunther 
to the position of General Manager, Ontyme Systems, in the newly 
formed McDonnell Douglas Electronic Messaging Systems Company 
(MDEMS, a part of Network Systems Company).  Dick will report to 
Terry Donaher, Vice President, MDEMS.

Dick brings over 25 years of experience in the computing and 
communications industries to MDEMS.  Over the past four years, 
he has made many contributions to the strategic plans of Tymnet 
and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group, most 
recently by chairing the ISG Communications Opportunities Task 
Force and by spearheading the effort to create MDEMS.  He was 
instrumental in the acquisition of FTC Communications, the other 
principal component of MDEMS.

During the balance of 1985, Dick will focus on developing a 1986 
operating plan for Ontyme Systems, and organizing the business 
unit to start the new year with increased momentum.

The recent announcement of the formation of MDEMS stressed that 
a key to ISG's success will be how well MDEMS works with all the 
other business units to distribute its products and services.  
Dick is making this his top priority.  Please join me in 
welcoming him to MDEMS and give him your full support in his 
efforts to achieve our mutual objectives.

Subject:     Property Removal System


On 25 October 1985 an OnTyme message was sent to all managers in
reference to the new property removal system.  It was requested
that all managers contact the Security Department for further
information.

This message is being sent to reissue the above request to all
managers so that the new property removal system can be properly
implemented.

Those managers who have already contacted the Security Department
in reference to the new property removal system should disregard
this message.

The Security Department can be reached at X7075 Monday thru Friday
8AM till 5PM.

Encl:     (1) Supported   Hardware   and  Software  Products  for
              Automated Office Systems


1.  MDC  Standards,  Reference  (a),  provide a list of preferred
    hardware  and  software standards for office automation.  For
    ISG  use,  Reference (b), we are continuing with only the IBM
    Personal  Computer  (PC) and IBM Personal Computer XT (PC/XT)
    devices   for   automated  office  systems.    Enclosure  (1)
    provides   the  current  standard  configurations  for  these
    systems.

2.  Configurations  in Enclosure (1) have been updated to reflect
    new  software versions for Multimate (Advantage Version 3.6),
    Lotus  1-2-3  (Version  2),  and  DOS  (Version  3.1).    All
    existing  PC  and  PC/XT users will receive software upgrades
    for  these products in December 1985.  Update procedures will
    be announced by separate Administrative Bulletin.

3.  Lotus  Version 2 will not require use of the system diskette,
    provides    accelerated    calculations    using   the   math
    coprocessor,  and  provides  file  password capability. Lotus
    1-2-3  Aids  in  Enclosure  (1)  have  been  removed from the
    Preferred  Options  due  to these features now being provided
    by Lotus.

4.  The   User   Support   Centers   are   available  to  provide
    information  and assistance for the above changes and for new
    system order configurations. USC phone numbers are:

Subject:  NORTHERN    CA   METROPOLITAN   SERVICES   ORGANIZATION
          APPOINTMENTS



As  a result of the formation of the new Northern CA Metropolitan
Services  Organization,  I  am  pleased to announce the following
assignments.    This  organization  will  provide  facilities and
other  general  services  support  to ISG's Northern CA corporate
properties.    A  more  detailed  statement  of  charter is being
direct  mailed  to  affected  business  unit  presidents or their
designees.

    Bob  Beach  is appointed Manager - Plant Engineering Services
    with  responsibility  for interior design, space planning and
    allocation,   engineering   and  construction  services,  and
    regulatory  compliance.  Many of you will know Bob, as he has
    served  Tymshare and its predecessor companies for many years
    in  a  variety  of  capacities,  most  recently as Facilities
    Manager, Northern California properties.

    Leo  German  is  promoted  to  Manager - Maintenance Services
    with  responsibility  for  service  contract  administration,
    preventative  and  on-call maintenance, and landlord liaison.
    Leo  has  been with Tymnet almost two years, most recently as
    Staff   Facilities   Engineer,  Network  Facilities.    While
    relatively  new  to ISG, Leo has over 20 years' experience in
    facilities maintenance and operations.

    Chuck  Herman  is  appointed  Manager - General Services with
    responsibility  for  mail  services, reprographics, and voice
    communications.    Distribution  services, as well, are under
    study  for  possible  centralization  under  this department.
    Chuck  has  been  with  Tymnet  for  less than a year, in the
    capacity  of  Manager,  Non-Network Facilities.  While new to
    ISG,  Chuck has over 15 years' experience in general services
    and facilities operations.

    Wanda  Smith  is  continuing  in  her assignment as Manager -
    Administration.   However, as we have recently integrated our
    Network  Facilities  Department  with  the  new  Metropolitan
    Services   Organization,  Wanda's  responsibilities  will  be
    expanded  to include full support to the MSO.  Wanda has been
    with   Tymnet   almost   two  years,  following  considerable
    experience    in   other   Facilities,   Real   Estate,   and
    Administrative organizations.

    Mark  Lauver,  Director  of Facilities, MDNSC, will be Acting
    Manager  -  Metropolitan Services until further notice.  This
    organization,  as  well as the Network Facilities Department,
    will continue to report to Mark.

Please  join  me  in  congratulating  these  folks  on  their new
assignments  and  responsibilities.  They, and I, will appreciate
your support and cooperation as we tackle these new challenges.

Subject:  PLACEMENT,  ADVANCEMENT, COUNSELING AND TRAINING (PACT)
          PROGRAM


Entrance  into  the PACT Program's displaced workers and training
functions   was  suspended  in  August  1985  because  of  budget
constraints.    After  careful  consideration, we have decided to
discontinue  PACT  as  of  December  31,  1985.   The decision to
discontinue  PACT  was difficult and is based solely on financial
considerations.

The   Program   was   successful   in  redeploying  and  training
employees.    A  total of 299 ISG employees participated in PACT.
Eighty  three percent of this total or 248 employees were trained
and  placed  in new productive positions within ISG and other MDC
components.   The majority of the remainder had job offers within
MDC prior to leaving.

The  Internal  Placement  function will continue as part of Human
Resources  at  both  the  Business Unit and Regional levels.  All
transfers  within  or  between  ISG  Business  Units, group staff
organizations  and  MDC  organizations  external  to  ISG will be
administered  by  the  Human  Resources  function  supporting the
affected  organizations.    Transfers  for Business Units that do
not  currently  have Human Resources functions will be handled by
the  Regional  staffs.    Questions  concerning  support  at  the
regional  levels should be directed to Dennis Carvalho, St. Louis
Region, or Wylie Taylor, Western Region.

Our  appreciation  for  a  job  well  done  and  best  wishes for
continued  success  in  your  new  positions  to  the PACT team -
Jerry  Sexauer,  Mel  Bradford,  Regina  Higgins,  Larry Jenkins,

Subject:  Addition   to   Policy   5-MDC  section-ISG  Management
          Handbook



1.  Policy  5  in  the MDC section of the ISG Management Handbook
    discusses    the    HQ-authorized    manuals    which    have
    corporate-wide  applicability.    The appendix to this Policy
    contains a listing of those manuals.

2.  The   Corporate  Information  Resource  Management  Standards
    should be added to this appendix.

3.  The  purpose  of this manual is to disseminate Corporate-wide
    standards  for Information Resource Management principles and
    practices,   standards   for  systems  analysis  and  design,
    software,    equipment,    telecommunications,    information
    processing, systems integrity, and data administration.

4.  The  person responsible for development and revision of these
    standards  is  the  Director-Information  Resource Management
    Hardware/Software   Technology,   with  minimum  coordination
    required with the component IRM function heads.

5.  Distribution,  publication, and control of this manual is the
    responsibility  of  the  Manager-MDC  Procedures.    Approval
    resides  with  the  Staff Vice President-Information Resource
    Management.

6.  Other areas of the handbook remain unchanged.

7.  In  January  1986,  ISG Policy Management will distribute the
    quarterly  update  of the Management Handbook.  At that time,
    a  new  page  will  be  provided  to  update  the text in the

THE SOFTWARE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE DELAYED THE CONVERSION ARE BEING RE-
SOLVED AT A RAPID PACE.  WE EXPECT RESOLUTION OF THE REMAINING PROBLEMS
BY THIS WEEKEND.  IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CONVERSION AS ORDERLY AND 
QUICK AS POSSIBLE, WE ARE SCHEDULING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SUPER-
VISOR FOR 3:00 A.M. SUNDAY MORNING, 12/15.  THIS WILL ALLOW ONE WEEK
FOR CONVERSION, WHICH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE FEW REMAINING NODES.

CURRENT STATUS OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ARE:

940 NET - THE AUX CIRCUIT PROBLEM WHICH IMPACTED VALIDATIONS ON MONDAY
          HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND TESTING IS CONTINUING.

E-BUSS - NEW CODE IS BEING LOADED NOW WHICH FIXES THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

         1.  INPUT PROCESSING BEING STOPPED

         2.  LOGINS FROM X.25

         3.  LOGIN FROM HSA

         THE PROBLEM OF LOST OUTPUT DATA IS A BUG IN AN OLD VERSION OF 
         THE MONITOR ON SOME OF THE ADP 10'S.  THE FIX IS TO LOAD THE 
         LATEST VERSION OF THE MONITOR.

HSA KATAKANA - NEW VERSION WHICH FIXES ALL KNOWN PROBLEMS.

GATEWAY - NEW VERSION RELEASED WHICH FIXES:

          1. LOADii PROBLEM

          2. CRASH FROM 6C63

I HOPE I HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THE KNOWN PROBLEMS.  IF THERE ARE ANY NEW
CONCERNS, PLEASE RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.  ITIME IS SHORT, AND CONVERSION 
BECOMES MORE CRITICAL WITH EACH PASSING DAY.


THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IN THIS PROJECT,

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

=================================================================
 
 
EFFECTIVE  JANUARY  1,  1986,  DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS  COMPANY  WILL 
OFFICIALLY BE OUT OF THE EQUIPMENT LEASING BUSINESS.  IN THE PAST 
OUR DIVISION HAS HANDLED THE LEASING OF TERMINALS,  PRINTERS  AND 
MODEMS    TO   "TYMSHARE"   CUSTOMERS.     THIS   INCLUDED;   THE 
ADMINISTRATION, BILLING OF NEW LEASES, RENEWALS AND CANCELLATIONS 
AND PURCHASE CONVERSIONS.  
 
 
AS OF JANUARY 1, ALL OF THE ASSETS WILL TRANSFER OUT OF DSC FIXED 
ASSETS INTO THE COST CENTER OF THE BUSINESS  UNIT   RECEIVING THE 
MONTHLY  REVENUE  FROM THE CUSTOMER LEASING THE  EQUIPMENT.   THE 
BUSINESS UNIT NOW WILL BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  ASSETS.   THIS 
RESPONSIBILITY  INVOLVES  TAKING BACK THE EQUIPMENT,  SHOULD  THE 
CUSTOMER CANCEL.  DSC WILL NO LONGER:
 
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE PICK UP
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE BILLING
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE BILLING TO BE DISCONTINUED
 
                 o  RECEIVE THE EQUIPMENT INTO OUR WAREHOUSE
 
 
ANY EQUIPMENT THAT CANCELLED PRIOR TO DECEMBER 1, WILL BE  PICKED 
UP AND RETURNED  TO  OUR  WAREHOUSE.   ANY  CANCELLATION  LETTERS 
RECEIVED AFTER DECEMBER 2, WILL BE SENT TO THE CUSTOMERS'BUSINESS 
UNIT.
 
 
THERE IS HELP AVAILABLE FOR THE BUSINESS UNITS THAT LACK  STORAGE 
AREA.   IF  YOU  DO  NOT WANT OR NEED  YOUR  CUSTOMER'S  RETURNED 
EQUIPMENT YOU MAY CONTACT BOBBIE HINES AT  714/952-6555.   BOBBIE 
IS MANAGER OF  THE EQUIPMENT DISPOSITION AND SALES DEPARTMENT FOR 
ISG. SHE CAN HELP YOU DISPOSE OF YOUR ASSET AT FAIR MARKET VALUE.
 
 
NORTHERN  AIR  FREIGHT  HAS  HANDLED THE  PICK  UP  OF  CANCELLED 
EQUIPMENT FOR  SEVERAL YEARS.  THEY WILL GO TO THE CUSTOMER SITE; 
PACK  AND BOX THE EQUIPMENT AND SHIP TO YOUR DESIGNATED LOCATION.
THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (800/426-5962) WILL 
HANDLE  ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.

 
CURRENTLY,  MOST OF THE EQUIPMENT OUT ON LEASE HAS BEEN THERE FOR 
MORE  THAN  2 YEARS AND IS FULLY DEPRECIATED OR  HAS A  VERY  LOW 
BOOK  VALUE.   IT IS OUR SUGGESTION THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO GET  YOUR 
CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE THIS LEASED EQUIPMENT AT A LOW  COST.   THIS 
PURCHASE  WOULD  RESULT  IN  REVENUE FOR  YOUR  OFFICE  AND  YOUR 
CUSTOMER  COULD  SIGN  UP FOR A MAINTENANCE  AGREEMENT  WITH  THE 
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FIELD SERVICE COMPANY.  THIS WOULD PREVENT YOUR 
OFFICE FROM EVER HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE RETURN.
 
 
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS NEW POLICY YOU CAN  CALL 
YOUR COMPANY CONTROLLER OR ONTYME DAN SAENZ DSD.D/SAENZ.

Subject:  RESTRUCTURING OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
          COMPANY AND DISSOLUTION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
          DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS COMPANY


We need to do everything we can to ensure the ISG meets its 1986 
revenue and earnings objectives.  In line with this need I am 
announcing, effective today, the following organizational changes:

o   The North American Marketing and Sales organization that 
    formerly reported within McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
    Systems Company is now part of McDonnell Douglas Computer 
    Systems Company.  This restructuring will better equip the 
    Computer Systems Company to compete in the business systems 
    marketplace while it continues to meet ISG's internal hardware 
    manufacturing needs.  The restructured company will be headed 
    up by Otis Brinkley as President, with Vern Smith as Executive 
    Vice President.  In the coming weeks, Otis and Vern will work 
    together to develop an optimal structure for the Computer 
    Systems Company.

o   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company has been 
    dissolved in an effort to narrow the range of our business 
    activities and focus more on profitability.  The business 
    units within the Distribution Systems Company have been 
    reassigned as follows:

    -     Our Commercial Distribution Systems and Electronic Data 
          Interchange businesses are now part of McDonnell Douglas 
          Diversified Information Systems Company.  As such, these 
          businesses will continue to pursue their 1986 Operating 
          Plan objectives.

    -     Our embryonic Retail Systems business is being assigned 
          to ISG Marketing and Planning, where it will continue to 
          develop its strategy, though at a much lower level of 
          investment than we had planned for the balance of 1986.





1'm confident that these actions will increase our chances of 
achieving our 1986 objectives.  I'm counting on you not only to 
support these moves, but to do whatever you can to ease the 
transition for the people affected by them.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  elected medical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

All employees entering VG1 and VG2 can do so through the
front lobby entrance.  This entrance will be open 24 hours
a day during this weekend as well as the lobby to VG3.
All employees should have their vehicles moved to the
appropriate spaces no later than 5:00 AM on 8 March 1986.
Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

    meet only as occasionally required.

    Don  W.  Gerth has successfully completed his assignment to develop the
    policy  and  supervise the implementation of ISG's intercompany pricing
    mechanism.      Without   his  energy  and  attention  to  detail,  the
    intercompany  pricing  program would not be as complete as it is today.
    Effective  14  February  1986,  Don leaves ISG Marketing and returns to
    the  McDonnell  Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems Company.  Please
    join  me  in  expressing appreciation to Don for his outstanding effort
    over the past year.

    With   D.  W.  Gerth's  departure,  responsibility  for  the  continued
    operation  of  Intercompany  Pricing  is  transferred  to ISG Marketing
    Policy,  the  focal point for Intercompany Pricing administration.  All
    future  intercompany pricing matters should be addressed to L. H. Krone
    (I014/301/4E; Phone:  314-233-0002, ONTYME:  ISGHQ.L/KRONE).
    Your continued cooperation will be appreciated.

To:      ISG LISTS LEVEL A-E

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number 
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority 
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in 
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not 
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an 
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing 
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be 
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business 
    Units.

I am pleased to announce the assignment of Richard (Dick) Hatz to 
the position of Manager Contracts-ISG, reporting to me.

Dick's responsibilities in this new position will encompass both 
commercial and government contract policy statements, provide 
contract and negotiation assistance to the various business units 
on an as requested basis, and coordinate MDC corporate and ISG 
required contract related reports and special projects.

Reporting to Dick will be James (Jim) McDaniel who will be 
primarily responsible for performing government contracting 
activities relating to the above functions.  In addition, Jim is 
currently acting as the ISG focal point for the ISG Government 
Contract Survey.

Dick has twenty years of experience with MDC.  He started his 
career in MCAIR Procurement and for the past fifteen years with us 
has performed in various management positions in all areas of 
commerical and government contracts and pricing, both domestic and 
international.

Jim brings considerable expertise and experience in the government 
contracting sector and has been performing in various capacities 
in this regard since he joined MDC in May of 1979.

Please join me in wishing success to Dick and Jim in their new 
assignments.

As the final step in the division of responsibilities and personnel 
between the Diversified Controller's and ISG Group Controller's 
organizations, I am pleased to announce the appointment of Jerry L. 
Welsh as head of Commercial Contracts Administration for the 
Diversified Controller.

With MDC since 1972, Jerry originally was involved with governmental 
contracting for McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company and in 1976 
joined the McAuto Commercial Contracts group.  Subsequently he has 
held a series of positions of increasing responsibility within that 
organization and is well prepared to now assume a leadership role in 
the Diversified Controller's organization coordinating contractual 
activities in support of several Business Units - predominately 
Diversified Information Systems Company.

Jerry replaces Richard G. Hatz who, along with James G. McDaniel, 
will form the Contracts policy and coordination section of the ISG 
Group Controller's organization.

In addition to his existing contract development and negotiating 
team, Jerry will also have the Diversified contracts administrative 
groups in St. Louis and Vienna, Virginia reporting to him.

Please join me in wishing Jerry success in his new assignment.

For the past few months, there has been a struggle in the Vienna, Virginia 
office by the Veterans Administration (VA) Project Implementation Team to  
have VA surpass Southwest Bell as the largest Private Network for Tymnet.  
On Saturday, April 19, the efforts of a very dedicated Project Implementation   
Team resulted in the VA becoming the largest Private Network. It has surpassed  
Southwest Bell, which was previously the largest with a node count of 239. 
As of today, the VA Private Network installed node count is 245. 
     
The Project Implementation Team is headed by Allen Jakobitz, Sr. Project   
Manager, and Ed Macnamara, Project Manager.  The other team members are    
David Auerbach, Regional Technical Consultant; Dan Steinman, Communications
Consultant; Mike Betty, Communications Consultant and Mike Perez, Project  
Administrator.  This Project Implementation Team was also assisted by a    
concerted effort of the Field Engineering Organization, which has done an  
excellent job in providing support for this most complex project.
     
The VA contract was awarded in January of 1984 and installation of all the 
VA nodes will conclude in September of 1986, when the network will install 
its 320th node.
     
Congratulations and thanks go to all the members of the Project Implementation  
Team and all of Tymnet for the outstanding job that has been performed.

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number 
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority 
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in 
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not 
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an 
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing 
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be 
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business 
    Units.
