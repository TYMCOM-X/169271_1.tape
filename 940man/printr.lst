                               THE PRINTER PROGRAM
                               -------------------

LATEST UPDATE: 04-19-73



I. GENERAL:

DESCRIPTION:
------------

PRINTER IS A PRINT PACKAGE WHICH ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO OUTPUT
A HIGH SPEED LINE PRINTER LISTING OF A FILE OR FILES TO A NUMBER
OF OUTPUT DEVICES FROM DISC FILES OR MAGNETIC TAPE.





REQUIRED STATUS:
----------------

OPERATOR STATUS IS REQUIRED IF OUTPUTTING FILES TO THE 940 PRINTER
OR IF INPUTTING FROM MAGNETIC TAPE. ALL OTHER OPERATIONS DO NOT
REQUIRE STATUS.





OPERATION:
----------

TO CALL THE PROGRAM, IN THE EXEC TYPE:

-PRINTER    

THE PROGRAM WILL PROMPT WITH THE FOLLOWING:

LINES:
FILE:

CONTROL A IS ALLOWED FOR EDITING PURPOSES DURING RUNNING OF THIS PROGRAM.

AN ALTMODE WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM WILL RING A BELL, RELEASE THE
DEVICE TO WHICH THE FILE WAS BEING INPUT FROM OR OUTPUT TO, AND
RETURNS WITH THE FOLLOWING PROMPT:

ALTMODE
LINES:

A CONTROL SHIFT O WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM WILL RETURN TO THE EXEC WITHOUT
RELEASING THE DEVICE TO WHICH THE FILE IS BEING INPUT FROM OR OUTPUT TO, UNLESS AN ALTMODE
WAS PREVIOUSLY TYPED.

TO TERMINATE THE PROGRAM TYPE Q AS A RESPONSE TO THE "FILE:" OR
"LINES:" PROMPT; TYPE A CARRIAGE RETURN AFTER THE FILENAME OR
TAPE OPTION.

A CARRIAGE RETURN FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE LINE FEED WILL GIVE A DIRECTORY
OF THE TAPE MOUNTED ON UNIT ZERO WITH 39 LINE FORMAT TO THE 940 LINE PRINTER. IF
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TAPE, AS IN AN ALL FILES, THE PROGRAM, UPON COMPLETION OF THE FIRST TAPE
DIRECTORY WILL CHECK TO SEE IF UNIT ONE IS READY. IF SO A TAPE DIRECTORY WILL ALSO
BE MADE OF THIS TAPE, IF NOT THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE. UPON COMPLETION OF THIS SECOND
TAPE DIRECTORY THE PROGRAM WILL CHECK TO SEE IF A NEW TAPE HAS BEEN MOUNTED ON UNIT ZERO
AND THAT IT IS IN READY,IF SO THE PROGRAM WILL PRINT A TAPE DIRECTORY OF THIS TAPE.
IF NOT THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE. THIS OPTION WILL CONTINUE IN THIS MANNER UNTIL IT
FINDS THAT A TAPE DRIVE IS NOT IN READY OR THAT A NEW TAPE HAS NOT BEEN MOUNTED.





OPTIONS:
--------

LINES:  CAN BE ANSWERED WITH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:

         S   -FOR SMALL PAPER,8" HIGH X 11" WIDE, 39 LINES PER PAGE
         B   -FOR LARGE PAPER,11" HIGH X 14" WIDE, 54 LINES PER PAGE
         NN  -WHERE NN=NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE TO BE PRINTED

        IF THIS OPTION IS FOLLOWED BY A LINE FEED IT WILL, AFTER COMPLETING THE "FILE:"
        OPTIONS, RETURN WITH THE PROMPT "LINES:". IF THIS OPTION IS TERMINATED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN
        THE PROGRAM WILL EITHER TERMINATE AFTER "FILE" OPTIONS OR RETURN WITH THE PROMPT "FILE:".

FILE:  CAN BE ANSWERED WITH 8 BASIC OPTIONS;

           FILENAME
           ALL FILES
           TO
           USE
           FROM
           COPY
           START WITH
           START AT

THE LAST SIX  OPTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A SPACE AND A FURTHER COMMAND

THE FILENAME AND ALL FILES OPTIONS CAN BE TERMINATED WITH EITHER A CARRIAGE
RETURN OR A LINE FEED. THE LINE FEED WILL RETURN WITH THE PROMPT "FILE:" AFTER THE LAST FILE
PRINTED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING OPTION. THE CARRIAGE RETURN WILL RETURN TO THE EXEC
AFTER THE LAST FILE PRINTED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING OPTION.

ALL OPTIONS CAN BE COMBINED, HOWEVER IF MORE THAN ONE SUBOPTION IS USED FROM ONE OF THE 
BASIC OPTIONS, THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE LAST SUBOPTION TYPED.I.E.
IF YOU TYPE USE HEAD, AND AFTER THAT ENTERED "USE CHEAD" THE PROGRAM WOULD USE CHEAD.

       FILENAME  - WILL OUTPUT THE FILENAME GIVEN TO THE 940 LINE
                   PRINTER UNLESS ANOTHER OUTPUT DEVICE HAS BEEN
                   SPECIFIED.
       ALL FILES - WILL OUTPUT ALL SYMBOLIC FILES IN THE DIRECTORY
                   CURRENTLY IN USE (GFD OR LOGIN).
       TO        - THE TO OPTION IS USED TO INDICATE DIFFERENT OUTPUT DEVICES. THIS OPTION
                   MUST BE TERMINATED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN, AND CAN BE USED IN COMBINATION
                   WITH THE USE,FROM,AND COPY OPTIONS. THE VOGUE, DP, AN CDC OPTIONS 
                   CHECK TO SEE THAT THE OPERATOR RUNNING THE PROGRAM IS
                   CONNECTED TO PORT ZERO OR PORT ONE ON THE TYMSAT, IF NOT THE PROGRAM WILL
                   RETURN WITH THE FOLLOWING ERROR MESSAGE:
                   "EXTERNAL DEVICES-PORT ZERO ONLY" AND WILL RETURN TO THE EXEC.
                 
                   TO VOGUE    -ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO PRINT ON A VOGUE PRINTER.
                   TO DP       -ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO PRINT ON A DATA PRODUCTS PRINTER.

                                THIS OPTION IS THE DEFAULT CONDITION IF NO OUTPUT DEVICE
                                OPTION IS USED.

       USE       - THE USE OPTION ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO SELECT DIFFERENT OUT PUT FORMATS
                   FOR HIGH SPEED PRINTER LISTINGS. THIS OPTION MAY BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH
                   THE TO, FROM, AND COPY OPTIONS AND MUST BE TERMINATED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN.

                   USE HEAD   -ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO PRINT A FILE WITH THE OLD 1HEAD
                               FORMAT; ON SMALL PAPER,WITH PAGE NUMBERS AND FILE IDENT
                               AT THE TOP RIGHT CORNER OF EACH PAGE.
                   USE CHEAD  -ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO PRINT A FILE WITH THE OLD 1CHEAD FORMAT;
                               ON SMALL PAPER,WITH TITLE PAGE AT BEGINNING OF EACH FILE
                               AND PAGE NUMBERS  AT THE TOP RIGHT CORNER OF EACH PAGE.
                               THIS OPTION REQUIRES THAT YOU ALWAYS ENTER BOTH USERNAME AND FILENAME,
                               UNLESS THIS OPTION IS BEING COMBINED WITH THE FROM TAPE OPTION,
                               IN WHICH CASE THE USERNAME NOR THE FILENAME WOULD BE REQUIRED.
                   USE BIGCHEAD-ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO PRINT A FILE WITH THE OLD 1BIGCHEAD
                                FORMAT; LARGE PAPER, TITLE PAGE AT BEGINNING OF EACH FILE AND
                                PAGE NUMBERS IN TOP RIGHT CORNER OF PAGE. AGAIN THIS
                                OPTION REQUIRES THAT YOU ALWAYS ENTER BOTH THE USERNAME AND THE FILENAME,
                                UNLESS THIS OPTION IS BEING COMBINED WITH THE FROM TAPE OPTION,
                                IN WHICH CASE THE USERNAME NOR THE FILENAME WOULD BE REQUIRED.
                   USE BIGHEAD-ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO PRINT A FILE WITH THE OLD 1BIGHEAD
                               FORMAT; LARGE PAPER, PAGE NUMBERS AND FILE IDENT IN
                               TOP RIGHT CORNER OF EACH PAGE.
                   USE LC     -ENABLE AN OPERATOR TO PRINT A FILE USING LOWER CASE CHARACTERS
                               THIS OPTION CAN ONLY BE USED WITH A PRINTER THAT HAS A 
                               LOWER CASE CHARACTER SET,I.E. THE CDC PRINTER. THIS
                               OPTION IF NOT SPECIFIED WILL DEFAULT TO THE CONDITION
                               WHERE IF A FILE HAS LOWER CASE CHARACTERS, THEY WILL BE 
                               CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE CHARACTERS AND PRINTED.
                   USE TITLE  -ENABLES AN OPERATOR TO PRINT A FILE WITH THE FILENAME
                               AND DATE AND TIME PRINTED AT THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF THE

                               OR 1BIGPRINT PROGRAMS. THIS IS THE DEFAULT CONDITION
                               IF NO OPTION FROM THE HEADING CATEGORY IS SPECIFIED.


        FROM      - THIS OPTION IS DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES.
                    1. FROM TAPE, 2. FROM FILENAME. THIS OPTION CAN BE COMBINED WITH
                    THE TO,USE, AND COPY OPTIONS.
                    
                    FROM TAPE     -WILL ALLOW AN OPERATOR TO PRINT FROM MAGNETIC TAPE.
                                   THIS OPTION WILL RESPOND WITH THE FOLLOWING PROMPTS:

                                   NNN BPI-POS-RNG:
                                   POS-RNG:

                                   NNN=556,800, OR 200 WHICHEVER IS SET ON THE TAPE DRIVE.

                                   THE RESPONSE TO EITHER OF THESE TWO PROMPTS CAN BE:
                                   
                                   D-FOR A TAPE DIRECTORY. AGAIN IF THERE IS MORE
                                     THAN ONE TAPE THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE
                                     DIRECTORIES TO THE 940 PRINTER WITH THE 39 LINE FORMAT
                                     AS LONG AS A TAPE IS MOUNTED AND IN READY ON UNITS 
                                     ZERO AND ONE, AND THAT IT IS A DIFFERENT TAPE.
                                N-NN-FOR A RANGE OF TAPE POSITIONS THAT AN OPERATOR
                                     WISHES TO HAVE PRINTED.N=SOME OCTAL NUMBER.
                                   N-FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TAPE POSITION THAT AN OPERATOR WISHES TO
                                     HAVE PRINTED. N=SOME OCTAL NUMBER.

                    FROM FILENAME -WILL ALLOW AN OPERATOR TO PRINT A NUMBER OF FILES
                                   THAT ARE LISTED IN A PARTICULAR FILENAME.

        COPY      -THIS OPTION ALLOWS AN OPERATOR TO OBTAIN MORE THAN ONE COPY OF A FILE.
                   TO USE THIS OPTION TYPE :

                   COPY NN FILENAME
                         OR
                   COPY NN FROM TAPE
                         OR
                   COPY NN FROM FILENAME

                   IN RESPONSE TO THE PROMPT "FILE:"
                   NN=THE NUMBER OF COPIES NEEDED.

       START WITH  -THIS OPTION IS USED WITH THE "FROM" OR "ALL FILES"
                    OPTIONS AND ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO START PRINTING
                    WITH A FILE OTHER THAN THE FIRST FILE.

                    EXAMPLE:

                            -PRINTER (CR)
                             LINES: S (CR)

                             FILE: ALL FILES (CR)

       START AT    -ALLOWS PRINTING TO BEGIN AT A PAGE OTHER THAN THE FIRST
                    PAGE. THIS WOULD NORMALLY BE USED TO COMPLETE A JOB
                    WHICH FOR SOME REASON WAS ABORTED.

                    EXAMPLE:

                            -PRINTER (CR)
                             LINES: S (CR)

                             FILE: /FILE/ (CR)
                             515 PAGES: /FILE/

                             PAGES PRINTED: 515
                            -

                            NOTE: PAGES 1-344 OF /FILE/ WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
                                  PRINTED. THE PAGE COUNT, HOWEVER, IS
                                  FOR THE ENTIRE FILE - NOT JUST THE PORTION PRINTED.
