                             ----------------------


     From the user's standpoint (therefore, from our viewpoint  as  well)  batch
work  is not complete until the user receives the work.  For example, although a
spool job was listed correctly (print quality, paper alignment etc.), this  only
has  value  as  a service when the customer receives the listing.  Our mail room
procedure must follow up with the final  steps  for  the  job  to  reflect  high
quality  service.   The  same applies to receiving deliveries from the customer:
The user depends on operation's follow up in the mail room so  the  delivery  is
promptly  available for input to the system and the user can get on with his/her
work.

     This document will outline the procedures and options availible for  pickup
and  delivery  of  batch  materials.  By clarifying and using these steps a high
level of mailing efficiency can be achieved and maintained seven days a week.


                                   PACKAGING
                                   ---------

     Be sure to wrap packages well, because the  Post  Office  will  not  accept
packages that are not securely wrapped.  Use gummed tape and fiberglass tape.

     In general, the acceptable package weight maximum is 50 lbs.  per  package.
If  an  item  exceeds this weight, it may be possible to split the item into two
packages.  If this is  necessary,  each  separate  package  may  need  it's  own
airbill.   The  other  alternative for packages heavier than 50 lbs.  is to ship
them from Tymshare Shipping/Recieving Department located in  building  D.   They
can become involved on days, Monday through Friday.

     All magnetic tapes sent out must be clearly labeled, have a rubber  grommet
and  be  contained in a tape canister.  After the tape has been boxed you should
stamp or write on "MAGNETIC TAPE:  DO NOT XRAY!" on the box.

     When you use the postage meter, be sure  the  meter  reflects  the  correct
date,  the  amount  of  postage is correct and that you are operating the device
correctly.  Scotch tape all labels and the postage meter tape to the package.

     Each and every batch request must be entered into accounting  with  BCHARGE
even if more than one request is sent in a package.  Enclose a copy of the batch
request or spool request in the package  and  keep  one  copy  for  the  postage
envelope.  Spool listings should have a XEROX copy of the request to be used for
postage.



                                 POSTAGE RATES
                                 -------------

     1 oz.  = .13

     Each oz.  after that, up to 1 lb.  = .11

     Anything 1 lb.  or over, use the Priority Mail chart on the bulletin board.

     Anything that is under $1.45 is stamped First Class.  Anything that is over
$1.45  is  stamped  Priority  -  even local mail.  Determine the Postage Zone by
looking at the zip code chart on the bulletin board.

     If an item is to be mailed 'special delivery' the following  postage  rates
should be added to the FIRST CLASS/PRIORITY charge:

     2 lbs. and under         add $1.25
     2.1 to 10 lbs.           add $1.50
     10 lbs. and up           add $1.75

     Be sure to use the 'SPECIAL DELIVERY' stamp on these parcels.

     Write the amount of postage on the batch request and place the  request  in
the  postage envelope.  The clerk will run the BCHARGE.  Log the mail out on the
sheets in the mail room - one for tapes, one for cards, and one for listings.

     Any overseas mailing should be left for the I/O Clerk to handle.

                  PROCEDURES FOR AIR-FREIGHT PRIORITY PARCELS
                  -------------------------------------------

     Priority items are batch requests with instructions  to  use  an  airlines,
airfreight,  or  other  special  service  for quick delivery.  Batch controllers
should be aware of batch with special delivery instructions and  follow  through
on  correctly  and  quickly  handling them.  If the I/O clerk is not on duty the
controller should package the job, select the appropriate delivery service,  and
arrange  for  pickup  as soon as possible after the job is completed.  Usually a
priority parcel must be at the airport ready to go an hour before the  scheduled
flight time.  This means (for example) Cal Parcel should be contacted at least 3
hours before flight time so there is adequate time for delivery of the parcel to
the  airport.   Don't  leave jobs with special delivery instructions for someone
else to handle.  The job is not done until it is on its way to the customer.

1.  Use Cal Parcel or I.A.C.  or Federal Express.   The  telephone  numbers  are
listed on the mailroom bulletin board.

2.  Airline schedules are in the mailroom.

3.  Be sure to list all parcels going air  freight  on  the  priority  clipboard
under the front window.  This applies whether the package is picked up while you
are here or not.

4.  The clerk will fill in the shipping charges.  You may leave them blank.

5.  Check prepaid for all parcels.

6.  Examples for filling out a shipping bill are on the bulletin  board  in  the
Bldg.  A mailroom.  BE SURE TO PUT THE BATCH REQUESTNUMBER ON THE BILLS.

7.  Airbills are available in the mail room for the  following  airlines:   PSA,
American,  and  TWA.   Be sure to list their numbers (located on the upper right
hand corner of the airbill) on the priority parcel  clipboard  under  the  front
window.

8.  If the parcel is going on an airline for which we don't have an airbill,  be
sure  to request with the courier to call with the airbill number so that it can
be logged onto the priority parcel clipboard under the front window.   Also  ask
for the shipping information.  The shipping information is the estimated time of
departure (ETD), and the estimated time of arrival (ETA).

9.  Be sure to fill out the address label completely, including the zip code.

10.  LEAVE COPIES OF ALL BATCH REQUESTS IN THE POSTAGE ENVELOPE SO THE CLERK CAN
RUN THE BCHARGE.

11.  Place all receipts on the clipboard next to the front window.

12.  Make a Xerox copy of all airbills after they are filled out.

13.  Be sure to have packages  delivered  on  the  other  end  unless  otherwise
instructed  by the customer.  Ask Cal Parcel for information about deliveries in
Chicago and New York.

14.  If a parcel is not to be delivered from  the  destination  airport  to  the


                                   I/O WINDOW
                                   ----------

     All batch materials received or sent out at  WCO  must  be  logged  on  the
appropriate  clipboard  beneath  the  I/O  window.   There  are  clipboards  for
listings, magnetic and paper tapes, and priority parcels.  The  only  exceptions
are batch going out via U.S.  Mail which is logged out in the Mail Log.

     The clipboards are critical in that they're our only source of  information
in  tracking  items  received or sent out at WCO.  When batch items are received
they should be logged on a clipboard and promptly delivered to  the  appropriate
building  for  processing.   When items are picked up by a customer or a courier
service they should be logged out on the appropriate clipboard.


                          RETURN DELIVERY OF MAG TAPES
                          ------ -------- -- --- -----

     When a mag tape PPR does not specify return delivery instructions send mail
to the user stating that the tape will be held for one week and then sent to the
user's district office.  Scotch tape two copies of the PPR securely to the tape;
label  the  PPR  copy  with  a  specific date to return the tape to the district
office;  and put the tape on the "DELAY BEFORE MAILING" shelf in the mail room.

     When a mag tape PPR asks that a tape be held for a specific time  and  then
scratched then:  scotch tape one copy of the PPR securely to the tape;  write on
the PPR copy in bold letters the date the tape should be scratched;  and put the
tape  in  the  "HOLD TAPE - SCRATCH" cabinet.  this is the same cabinet used for
holding cards for two weeks.

     When a tape transferred from 370 operations does not have  return  delivery
instructions in a batch request send mail to the requestor stating that the tape
will be held for one week and scratched.  Secure a copy of the batch request  to
the  tape;  indicate in large letters the date to scratch the tape;  and put the
tape in the "HOLD TAPE - SCRATCH" cabinet.

     Do not put any tapes on the 370 pickup shelf in the mail room unless a copy
of  a  batch request is attached and a tape label clearly in- dicates what to do
with the tape.  The 370 pickup shelf is not a dump for tapes we don't know  what
to do with.

     Please note that there is now a "HOLD TAPES - SCRATCH" and  "HOLD  CARDS  -
DESTROY" cabinet for BUILDING C as well as one for BUILDING A.

                            RETURN DELIVERY OF CARDS
                            ------ -------- -- -----

     Reminder......our policy for cards without return delivery instructions  is
to  send  mail to the user stating that the cards will be held for two weeks and
then destroyed.  Scotch tape a copy of the PPR to the cards;  mark on  the  copy
the  date the cards are to be destroyed;  and put the cards in the "HOLD CARDS -
DESTROY" cabinet.
