     I have talked with Gary Perez (Operations Manager in Cupertino) about
     the base for host C14.  The base changed from 145 to 232 some months
     ago.  It seems the bases in Cupertino will change from time to time
     because hosts must be moved back and forth when serious hardware
     problems are present.  This means the base can and will change if
     this move occurs.
 
     I believe the problem you are experiencing with accounting is related
     to the time zone assigned to the base; node 145 was assigned time
     zone 17 in the past, although I note it is mis-assigned at present
     (more later on this).  Node 232 is assigned time zone 8 now (pacific
     coast of U.S.).
 
     By copy of this memo I am asking Jim Buelna to change the time zone
     of node 232 to 17 (Central European Summer Time) as soon as possible.
     Jim, please let me know exactly what day this takes place so we can
     verify in the April accounting, once available.  Also, it appears
     node 145 is mis-assigned (bad format) in the (UAS)NDRPT.FIL.  Consid-
     ering the above it should now be assigned time zone 8.
 
     Also, Gary has assured us he will notify me if the base to host C14
     changes in the future.  I'll then notify Jim Buelna of the change so
     the time zone can be changed immediately (I think this will avoid

 
Host P90 accounting and PERP                                        Page 2
 
 
     accounting problems, if we can make the necessary changes the same
     day, since accounting is run once a day).
 
     Peter, I really believe the time-zone assignment is reason for the
     P90 problem, and it is likely the same thing occurred on other hosts.
     I do not have specific information indicating when the latest change
     occurred.  The April accounting will likely be incorrect until the
     time zone is changed for this node, which will hopefully be tomorrow.
 
     Peter, thank you very much for bringing this to my attention; I'm
     sure it has caused CT much frustration and inconvenience.  I hope the
     above change will clear up the issue.  I'll let you know what day the
     change takes place so you can verify in the April accounting.
 
     Best regards. Ken

Subject: UNDELE.MAC

Good luck finding it....

  PLEASE ASK (when you're not sure of something)!!!!!

UNDELETE was originally written by Todd Corenson, and later modified
by Greg Matoka.  It is written in SAIL and is completely in-compatible
with DIRIT as far as file specification scanning, etc.

If you are looking for a MACRO-10 source, i.e. UNDELE.MAC, you no doubt
will never find one that does what you're looking for.  I'm not sure
where the current sources are, but if they can't be found quickly on
system 930, [I'll check if you ask me to look], then the best thing to
do is to get them from archive.

I killed your TALS job, 'cause it was a waste of cpu time & tymnet
circuit traffic.  PS: Anyone with systat license can look at your job
and see what file it is reading, so putting your OPER password or
any OPER password into a file is a "no no".

PPS.  It is possible that you will not find UNDELE.SAI either, it was
originally called UNDEL.SAI and the command was UNDEL until too many
people complained to Todd that "UNDELETE file-spec" didn't work!!!!!!

              CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM



The Executive Board has approved moving forward with Phase I of 
the recommended plan for consolidation of selected field office 
locations into shared ISG Business Centers.

The initial metropolitan areas to be addressed in the plan include 
New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, 
Chicago, Denver, Houston and Dallas.  These eight areas represent 
over 50% of the annual ISG real estate lease expense and personnel 
in field locations.

A task force of real estate management representatives from five 
ISG business organizations will team with Dick Miskell, Director - 
ISG Field Facilities, to develop a specific detailed 
implementation plan and schedule for each metropolitan area.  The 
actual consolidation process will be implemented over a three year 
period and will involve other metropolitan areas.

An executive level Steering Committee comprised of representatives 
from six ISG organizations will be utilized to review and 
recommend policy needs.  These policy recommendations will support 
the implementation and remote office administration needs of the 
shared ISG Business Centers.  Specific areas to be addressed 
include the remote office administrative organization structures, 
office standards and the tenant cost allocation process for real 
estate lease expenses as well as common office services and 
equipment in the shared environment.

These new ISG Business Centers will increase McDonnell Douglas 
visibility in the ISG major market places, optimize office 
services through the larger shared office environment and obtain 
maximum leverage in lease negotiations to reduce long-term real 
estate lease expense.  Please give your support to the task force 
over the next few months to expedite completion of this task 
assignment by the Executive Board.

placed in advance by our ninth floor receptionist at the Towers.  
Please contact Julie Smith on (714) 250-1000 (Ext. 2062) to make 
your reservation.

If a meeting room is also required during your stay you will

provided at no charge, but breakfast will no longer be free.

This agreement provides substantial savings to the Company in one 
of the newest hotels in the airport area offering excellent 
facilities and service.  However, if you find any kind of problems 
with the service you receive while staying at the hotel, a call to 
Joan Mulry on Ext. 7318 - Facilities Department - will be all that 
is required for us to follow up with the hotel administration.

We expect all ISG organizations' personnel to take full advantage 
of this offer while in the Irvine area.

Subject: Packaging change (simplification) 

	First item:
Craig agrees that we do the following to save unnecessary redundancy,
especially when transmitting software to the domestic, customer 2020's.

We check the current copy of the executable binary file of the program
on the "production location hosts" (as they are called on the
transmittal form) to determine if they are identical with the executable
binary file created by our reconstruction of the file from the archived
source files.  This checking is done in this way:
	1.)  Determine the version number of the file built from the
sources and of the files on the production hosts.
	2.)  Determine the checksum of the file built from the sources
and of the files on the production hosts.
	3.)  If the production host's file has the same version number
and checksum as the file built from sources, telecopy this executable
binary file from the production host to another file name on the host
with the executable binary file rebuilt from sources.  Check for any
differences between the two files with the 'differences' command (which
runs the FILCOM program).

If the executable binary file from the production host is identical to
the executable binary file built from sources, transmittal of the
executable binary file to the production host is unnecessary.  This
transmittal should definitely NOT be done if the host is a customer host
(such as a domestic 2020).

	Second item:
The names of the packages that Craig suggested for the transmittal data
base, TRABAS, (and thus for everyone's access to the packages in
archives) is a 6 character mnemonic name, such as the filename part of
the file-id in the .DOC file in the archive FDM file, with ".PKG" as the
last four of the 10 characters allowed in the TRABAS and ARCHIV data
bases.  E.g.: the COMMAND package will be called "COMMAN.PKG" on the
"Software name" line of the transmittal form.

Since this name will be the name by which the package will be known
henceforth, we should be careful about what we choose for the first six
characters.  Coordination of this naming is recommended if you have any
questions.

	Third item:

Re. retransmittals of previously released packages:  If the package has
been transmitted, the "production" hosts' software has been installed,
and no changes to these installed files are to be made, then the new
transmittal should be marked "Archive only".

Every package transmitted should be re-transmitted with the following
changes, and these changes should be implemented for every new package
transmitted.:
	1.)  Package name should follow the new convention of
"<6-character name>.PKG".
	2.)  Version number(s) for packages should reflect the new
convention, including the manner in which the FDM file's name is
affected by the version numbering scheme.  Package file name format:

	"<4-char pkg name abbrev.>n[A|T].mmm"
(where:  n = digit 0 thru 9, reflecting the host class;
	 "A" or "T" = code reflecting Archive or Transmittal file; and
	 mmm = package version number, starting with 001.)

	3.)  The transmittals should include the following additional
information about EACH included program and instructions to Software
Distribution to enter this information into the TRABAS data base:  
	    a.)  System number:  packaging host number;
	    b.)  Program name:  name of individual program, as in last
transmittal of individual program;
	    c.)  Transmittal number:  (numbering method to be
determined); 
	    d.)  Version number:  version number of the individual
program;
	    e.)  Programmer name:  name of programmer who wrote the
current version of the individual program;
	    f.)  File name:  name of the package's current archive FDM
file; 
	    g.)  File extension:  extension of the package's current
archive FDM file.

If you have any questions, please ask,
Dennis

Subject: PACKAGE NAMES 

To allow access through the TRABAS data base, package names must be
restricted to 10 characters, max.  Craig and I have decided upon a
convention for package naming, based upon this restriction.

The package names, for the "Software name" line of the transmittal form,
and for further abbreviation into the file names for the package FDM
files will have this format:

	nnnnnn.PKG
(where:  "nnnnnn" = 6-character abbreviation of the package name.)

For creating the FDM file names, the first four characters of this
6-character abbreviation will be used.  The following "software names"
will be used for the package names:

PACKAGE NAME			'SOFTWARE' NAME
------------			---------------
operating system		OPRSYS.PKG
monitor invoked procedures	MONPRC.PKG
load complex			LDCPLX.PKG
startup				STARTU.PKG
session				SESSIO.PKG
accounting			ACCTNG.PKG
access				ACCESS.PKG
license				LICENS.PKG
master license			MSTRLC.PKG
disk/tape			DSKTAP.PKG
operator tools			OPRTLS.PKG
information			INFORM.PKG
commands			COMMAN.PKG
file operations			FILOPS.PKG


Thanks!

Subject: Pkging: 2020s 

In the first round, we will not create any packages for any of the 2020
hosts, unless the the software on the 2020s won't require updating, or
the updating the software in the packages won't require updating any
software in any other packages.  In the first round, in most cases the
package to create will be the package for the PDP-10's.  We will create
a zero level (universal) package only if that will be the final
configuration:  only if the software on the 2020's is exactly the same
as the software on the PDP-10's.  If there is to be a "2" level package
(for the 2020's only), it will not be assembled until after the packages
for all the Tymshare PDP-10s are completed.

     Subject:      ISG Top Management Appointments



     1.  I am very pleased to announce effective immediately the 
         appointments of Bob Fischer and Gary Liebl as the Information 
         Systems Group Executive Officer and the Group Operating 
         Officer, respectively.  As such they will constitute the 
         headquarters of ISG and will have all business units and group 
         staffs reporting to them.  They will operate as a team with 
         Bob performing the chief executive duties, such as strategic 
         planning, policy formulation and coordination, 
         acquisitions/divestitures, corporate interface, group 
         organizational matters, and supervision of the group staff.  
         Reporting to Bob, Gary will perform the chief operating 
         duties, including overseeing the operation of all the business 
         units, operating plans, productivity programs, and business 
         unit organizational matters.  Both Bob and Gary will continue 
         as MDC officers with the title of Corporate Vice President.

     2.  The breadth and depth of the capabilities spread across our 
         business units offers ISG a unique opportunity.  Bob and Gary 
         will share responsibility for fostering intercomponent 
         relationships to maximize the benefits of this strength.  
         Strategy implementation and strategic and operating results 
         will also be shared responsibilities.

     3.  Temporarily continuing to report to Bob will be McDonnell 
         Douglas Financial Transaction Systems, McDonnell Douglas 
         Information Processing, Dynatax, Unitax and MSGI.  Most of 
         these should be transitioned to Gary by the end of this year.

     4.  I am very enthusiastic about the new ISG headquarters 
         structure and especially about the two new executives who 
         constitute the headquarters team.  Both are seasoned 
         executives with outstanding records, both are highly 
         action-oriented, both know the business intimately, both have 
         strong marketing backgrounds, both are strong advocates of our 
         new culture, both have contributed greatly to the ISG vision 
         and organizational structure as it has evolved, both are team 
         builders, both are outstanding, demanding leaders.   They also 
         represent a good balance in that Bob has extensive large 
         company experience, will continue to be located in St. Louis, 
         and is especially strong in strategic vision and in broad 
         communications/team building.  Gary on the other hand has 
         extensive smaller company experience, will continue to be 
         located in Southern California, and is especially strong in 
         tight operating control and in executive team building.


     5.  Needless to say, the Blue and Gold Sectors are hereby 
         dissolved, as promised.  With essentially all the business 
         units reporting to Gary, ISG will now be run as one integrated 
         group.

     6.  For now there will be a centralized finance support center in 
         St. Louis to provide financial support for those business 
         units which do not yet have fully functional financial 
         organizations.  The goal will be to achieve business unit 
         independence and have the people in this organization placed 
         within those business units no later than the end of 1986.  In 
         addition, decisions on how business units will continue to 
         obtain human resources and law support will be announced soon.

     7.  Concurrent with Bob's and Gary's promotions, Rich Calvert, 
         Jerry Causley, and Vern Smith are promoted to the positions of 
         President of McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information 
         Systems, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International, 
         and McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems, respectively.

     8.  With these actions the top level organizational structure of 
         ISG is complete with the one exception of the communications 
         industry business unit.  That awaits the completion of the 
         study by the communications industry strategic task force.  
         That should be accomplished by the end of June.

     9.  With the implementation of this organizational structure my 
         active role in ISG will be complete, and I shall return to my 
         other role as President of MDC.  I can do that with great 
         peace of mind and confidence that ISG is in the hands of an 
         outstanding leadership team.

Subject: Packaging change (simplification) 

	First item:
Craig agrees that we do the following to save unnecessary redundancy
when transmitting software to the domestic, customer 2020's.

We check the current copy of the executable binary file of the program
on the "production location hosts" (as they are called on the
transmittal form) to determine if they are identical with the executable
binary file created by our reconstruction of the file from the archived
source files.  This checking is done in this way:
	1.)  Determine the size of the file built from the sources and
of the files on the production hosts, in memory words (not just in
memory pages).  This is done with the "DIR" command, using the "/WORDS"
switch.
	2.)  Determine the version number of the file built from the
sources and of the files on the production hosts.
	3.)  Determine the checksum of the file built from the sources
and of the files on the production hosts.

If the size (in memory words), the version number and the checksum are
all identical, it can be assumed that the files are identical.  If the
executable binary file from the production host is identical to the
executable binary file built from sources, transmittal of the executable
binary file to the customer host (such as a domestic 2020) should not be
done.

	Second item:
The names of the packages that Craig suggested for the transmittal data
base, TRABAS, (and thus for everyone's access to the packages in
archives) is a 6 character mnemonic name, such as the filename part of
the file-id in the .DOC file in the archive FDM file, with ".PKG" as the
last four of the 10 characters allowed in the TRABAS and ARCHIV data
bases.  E.g.: the COMMAND package will be called "COMMAN.PKG" on the
"Software name" line of the transmittal form.

Since this name will be the name by which the package will be known
henceforth, we should be careful about what we choose for the first six
characters.  Coordination of this naming is recommended if you have any
questions.

	Third item:

Re. retransmittals of previously released packages:  If the package has
been transmitted, the "production" hosts' software has been installed,
and no changes to these installed files are to be made, then the new
transmittal should be marked "Archive only".

Every package transmitted should be re-transmitted with the following
changes, and these changes should be implemented for every new package
transmitted.:
	1.)  Package name should follow the new convention of
"<6-character name>.PKG".
	2.)  Version number(s) for packages should reflect the new
convention, including the manner in which the FDM file's name is
affected by the version numbering scheme.  Package file name format:

	"<4-char pkg name abbrev.>n[A|T].mmm"
(where:  n = digit 0 thru 9, reflecting the host class;
	 "A" or "T" = code reflecting Archive or Transmittal file; and
	 mmm = package version number, starting with 001.)

	3.)  The transmittal should include instructions to Software
Distribution to enter the following information about EACH program in
the package into the TRABAS data base.  The information marked with an
asterisk should be included in the package's documentation file, for
information to Software Distribution.  The instructions should indicate
this location of this information.
	    a.)  System number:  packaging host number;
	    b.)  *  Program name:  name of individual program, as in
last transmittal of individual program;
	    c.)  *  Version number:  version number of the individual
program;
	    d.)  *  Programmer name:  name of programmer who wrote the
current version of the individual program;
	    e.)  File name:  name of the package's current archive FDM
file; 
	    f.)  File extension:  extension of the package's current
archive FDM file.

If you have any questions, please ask,

Subject: Pkging: 2020s 

In the first round, we will not create any packages for any of the 2020
hosts, unless the the software on the 2020s won't require updating.  In
these cases (probably very few) the package for the 2020's will be for
"archive only".

In the first round, in most cases the package to create will be the
package for the PDP-10's.  We will create a zero level (universal)
package only if that will be the final configuration:  only if the
software on the 2020's is exactly the same as the software on the
PDP-10's.  If there is to be a "2" level package (for the 2020's only)
with any software updating, it will not be assembled until after the
packages for all the Tymshare PDP-10s are completed.
