                  TELECOPY - MOVING FILES ON TYMNET
                  --------   ------ ----- -- ------



       ((INTRODUCTION))


            TELECOPY is a file transfer program  used  to  copy  files
       between  two  Tymshare  host computer systems.  It can copy any
       type of files to or from similar systems (ie.  one TYMCOM-X  to
       another  TYMCOM-X)  or  it can transfer any symbolic file to or
       from different types of hosts (ie.  TYMCOM-X to TYMCOM-IX).

            In all cases, the conventions and protocols of the systems
       involved  must be followed.  For example, on the TYMCOM-IX, the
       maximum allowable file size is the same for TELECOPY as  it  is
       for the EXEC command 'COPY'.  Also, the file naming conventions
       must meet the syntax requirements on both the sending  and  the
       receiving systems.

            To copy files between systems with  this  program,  it  is
       necessary   that  the  same  username  be  valid  on  both  the
       originating host and the  destination  host.   It  is  best  to
       TELECOPY  files  from  one  username  on  a  system to the same
       username on the other system.  Files can be copied either  from
       or  to  the  system the user is currently logged on, but he/she
       must be logged in to one of the two  systems  involved  in  the
       TELECOPY.   For example, if the user is logged into C33, he/she
       cannot telecopy from H8 to C38.

           Any of these commands may be shortened to the shortest
           unique command.


       As Tymshare personnel there is one additional legal command:

               TIME           SETS TIME SWITCH TO PROVIDE
                              PERIODIC STATUS REPORTS ON
                              CHARACTERS AND TRANSFER RATE.



       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))

            To start the program, enter  the  following  program  name
       from the exec:

               On TYMCOM-IX  hosts            'TELECOPY'
               On TYMCOM-X   hosts            'R TELECO'
               On TYMCOM-370 hosts            'TELECOPY'

       The program responds with a colon (:) prompt at which point the
       user  may  enter  any  valid  TELECOPY  command.  If any of the
       preliminary  commands  are  needed  to   establish   parameters
       relevant  to  the use of lower case characters, trailing blanks
       and so on, they should be input first.

            As a user with Tymshare licence, you may receive  progress
       reports periodically by using the 'TIME' command at this point.
       It is only necessary to do this once to set the  switch.   This
       will  also  report  the  rate  per  second characters are being
       transferred.

            To enter the file specification part  of  TELECOPY,  issue
       the command 'RUN (CR)'.

            When the RUN command is issued, the program  will  request
       the  "COPY  FROM" file and then the "COPY TO" file.  The syntax
       for entering this information is:

                      (USERNAME:SYSTEM NUMBER)FILE NAME

       For example:   (JONES:7)DATA

            It is possible to input the string  without  the  prompts.
       Type the information directly after the ':'.

            If the username or file name is omitted on the "TO"  side,
       the  "FROM"  information  is  used.   More  than  one  file may
       transferred (using same system, same user  name)  by  typing  a
       string of file names separated by commas.  If the system number
       is omitted on the "FROM" side, the logged in system is assumed.

            The command string is limited to 300 characters,  and  may
       be  typed  on several lines by ending intermediate lines with a
       line feed.  The string is terminated when a carriage return  is
       encountered.

            If an attempt is made to copy to  an  existing  file,  the
       program will ask for confirmation.

            The  message  "COPY  STARTING"  will  be  typed  when  the
       transfer of the data starts.

            Upon completion, the message "FILE COPIED TO FILE" will be
       displayed on the terminal.



                   TYMCOM-IX SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS


            The following differences prevail when using this  program
       to  transfer  files  from or to a TYMCOM-IX and another type of
       host:

            Only symbolic files may  be  transferred.   Tymcom-x  line
       numbered  files, such as created with LINED, will have the line
       numbers stripped when transferring  to  the  TYMCOM-IX  system.
       TYMCOM-X  tabs will be expanded to spaces based on standard tab
       settings when transferring to  the  TYMCOM-IX.   The  TYMCOM-IX
       compressed  blanks  will  be  expanded when transferring to the
       TYMCOM-X.  File names must meet the syntax requirements of  the
       appropriate system.


                                    NOTE

           You are referred to  the  naming  conventions  for  the
           TYMCOM-IX  in  the  EXECUTIVE  MANUAL  (May  1976) page
           23,24.


                    TYMCOM-X SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS


            The following differences should be  borne  in  mind  when
       using  this  program to transfer files between the TYMCOM-X and
       other host types:

            Only symbolic files may  be  transferred.   TYMCOM-X  line
       numbered  files, such as created with LINED, will have the line
       numbers stripped when  transferred  to  the  TYMCOM-IX  system.
       TYMCOM-IX  compressed  blanks will be expanded when transferred
       to TYMCOM-X.  TYMCOM-X tabs will be converted to  spaces  based
       on  standard  tab  setting  when  transferred to the TYMCOM-IX.
       When transferring onto an old file on the TYMCOM-IX,  the  file
       will  be  opened  in  sequential  mode,  meaning  that  the old
       contents are lost.  This differs from  the  TYMCOM-IX  transfer
       where  old files are opened in update mode.  This means that if
       the the TELECOPY is aborted by using an escape key the original
       contents  of  the  old file will be preserved.  File names must
       meet the syntax requirements of the recipient system.


                                    NOTE

           Refer to the Tymshare XEXEC MANUAL  (Dec.   1974)  page
           13,14  for  a  discussion  of  valid  file names on the
           TYMCOM-X.



                   TYMCOM-370 SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS


            The following differences prevail when using this  program
       to  transfer  files from or to a TYMCOM-370 and another type of
       system:

            Only symbolic files may  be  transferred.   TYMCOM-X  line
       numbered  files, such as created with LINED, will have the line
       numbers stripped when transferring to  the  TYMCOM-370  system.
       TYMCOM-X  tabs will be expanded to spaces based on standard tab
       settings when transferring to the TYMCOM-370.  Blank  lines  in
       the  TYMCOM-X  file  will  cause  a  record of one blank on the
       TYMCOM-370, and if the file is returned to the  TYMCOM-X  by  a
       subsequent file transfer, the "SUPRESS" option should be given.
       File names must meet the syntax requirements of the appropriate
       system.


                                    NOTE

           For  a  discussion  of  these   requirements   on   the
           TYMCOM-370,  refer to Tymshare's 'CMS REFERENCE MANUAL'
           (Oct 1974) page 20-22.

       Here the same transfer is accomplished but prompting is
       omitted. It is assumed the user is logged on to C33 so the 'TO'
       system
       may also be omitted.

        TELECO TEXT SYSTEM 40'

       10354 CHARS. TRANSMITTED'


       In this example, the file is transferred to C35 with the same
       file name kept on both systems. Also, 'FROM' and 'TO'
       specifications
       are input together on the same line.

       ':'



       ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))


            If the error  message  'UNABLE  TO  LOG  INTO  SYSTEM  NN'
       outputs,  there is a possibility that the destination system is
       unavailable.   To  test  this   possibility,   login   to   the
       destination  system.   If  you can login, proceed to 'pull' the
       file from the source  system.   Another  cause  of  this  error
       message is attempting to use a different username on one system
       than another.  If not, perhaps one of the the usernames is  not
       valid on the host system it references.

            For error messages  in  the  form  'UNABLE  TO  OPEN  FILE
       FILENAME',  chances  are  there  is a protection on the file or
       directory involved.  Check this by using the  appropriate  EXEC
       commands that output file or directory protection status.

            The  error  message  'CIRCUIT  ZAPPED'  indicates  that  a
       telecommunications  problem  occurred during the TELECOPY.  For
       best results, quit out of telecopy and reenter the  program  to
       try   again.   If  the  method  of  old  file  overwriting  was
       sequential, then the destination file is probably gone.
