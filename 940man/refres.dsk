:C:    1REFRESH
                               1REFRESH
                               --------

       THIS PROGRAM MAPS THE ENTIRE DISC AND WRITES THE INDIVIDUAL MAPS
TO THE DISC.  IT MUST BE RUN TO INITILIZE THE MAPPING SYSTEM AND IS
ALSO RUN WHENEVER IT IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO REFRESH THE DISC.
WHEN NECESSARY, 1REFRESH IS RUN BEFORE THE SYSTEM MAP IS SET
(SEE 1SETMAP BELOW.)  IF THE SYSTEM MAP HAS BEEN SET IT IS NECESSARY
TO TAKE THE SYSTEM DOWN AND BRING IT UP AGAIN BEFORE RUNNING 1REFRESH.

       THE DISC MUST BE REFRESHED PERIODICALLY FOR THE FOLLOWING
REASONS:

  1.  BAD MAPS

       IF THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN OR IS TAKEN DOWN WITHOUT INVOLKING THE
MONITOR'S CRASH ROUTINES, THE IN-CORE DISC MAP IS NOT WRITTEN BACK
ONTO THE DISC.  AS THE KEY WORD IN THE DISC VERSION OF THIS MAP WAS
SET TO ZERO WHEN FIRST READ INTO CORE IT IS KEYED AS A BAD MAP.  THIS
WILL OCCUR IF THE SYSTEM DOES DOWN DUE TO A POWER FAILURE, IF IT IS
HUNG IN A LOOP MAKING BREAKPOINT SWITCH 4 INEFECTIVE, OR IF THE
OPERATOR TAKES THE SYSTEM DOWN BY USE OF THE RUN-IDLE-STEP SWITCH.
IS IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE OPERATOR ALWAYS TAKE THE SYSTEM DOWN USING
THE EXECUTIVE CRASH COMMAND.

  2.  GRADUAL LOSS OF DBITS

       ALL DBITS MAY NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISC VERSIONS OF THE MAPS
DUE TO:

       A.  UNPROCESSED DBITS IN THE MONITOR TABLE WHEN THE SYSTEM IS
           TAKEN DOWN.
       B.  CANCELLING USERS.  WHEN A USER IS CANCELLED HIS FILE DIR-
           ECTORY IS ERASED, HOWEVER, THE DELETE LOGIC IS NOT INVOLKED
           AND THE DBITS ARE NOT RECOVERED UNTIL THE NEXT DISC
           REFRESH.

       1REFRESH WILL REQUIRE FROM 20 MINUTES TO 45 MINUTES TO RUN
DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF FILES ON THE DISC.  A TYPICAL RUN OF
1REFRESH WOULD BE:

-1REFRESH  (CR)

NO. OF FILES:  5793

CONFLICT AT  55000174

TYPE YES TO DELETE BAD FILES  YES (CR)

DBITS:  0,5238
DBITS:  1,6803
DBITS:  2,561
DBITS:  3,523
DBITS:  4,0
DBITS:  5,0
DBITS:  6,0
DBITS:  7,0

       IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RUNNING 1REFRESH DOES NOT SET THE SYSTEM
FLAG TO BEING MAPPED.  1SETMAP MUST BE RUN AFTER THE DISC IS REFRESHED
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.
