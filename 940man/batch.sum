       TYMSHARE OFFERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SERVICES TERMED "BATCH"
SERVICES" OR "OFF-LINE SERVICES" THAT ARE HANDLED BY OUR OPERATIONS
GROUP OF THE DATA SERVICES DIVISION.  A MANUAL ENTITLED "OFF LINE SERVICES"
IS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS FOR $1.00.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS WRITING IS:
FIRST, ACT AS A GUIDE TO FIELD MARKETING AND SUPPORT AND THEIR
CUSTOMERS; SECOND, EXPLAIN WHAT OPERATIONS CAN DO WITH A BATCH
REQUEST;  THIRD, DEFINE VARIOUS PROCEDURES AND TERMS USED BY 
OPERATIONS WHEN PROCESSING A REQUEST;  FOURTH, SHOW GUIDELINES
WHICH IF USED WILL EXPEDITE A REQUEST; AND FIFTH, ANSWER SOME OF
THE QUESTIONS MOST OFTEN ASKED ABOUT OPERATIONS' PROCEDURES.

       WHAT IS A PERIPHERAL PROCESSING REQUEST (PPR)?
A PPR IS A BATCH REQUEST GENERATED BY A TYMSHARE PROGRAM ON THE 940
OR THE PDP-10 WHICH ALLOWS A USER TO REQUEST OPERATORS TO PERFORM
SOME JOB INVOLVING THE USE OF PERIPHERALS (MAG TAPE, LINE PRINTER, ETC).
THE TERM "BATCH REQUEST" AND PPR ARE INTERCHANGEABLE.
PPRS WHICH ARE ENTERED ON ALL HOST COMPUTERS ARE CLEARED BY A
BATCH CONTROLLER. SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS OF A BATCH CONTROLLER ARE
TO RECORD IN A LOG EACH BATCH REQUEST FROM EVERY SYSTEM AS IT IS
CLEARED AND TO INTERPERT THE REQUEST, ASSIGN A PRIORITY TO IT, AND FINALLY
GIVE IT TO THE RESPECTIVE SYSTEM OPERATOR TO PERFORM.  WHEN A BATCH REQUEST IS
COMPLETED BY THE OPERATOR, IT IS RETURNED TO THE BATCH CONTROLLER WHO DOUBLE
CHECKS THE WORK IN AN EFFORT TO FIND ANY POSSIBLE ERRORS OR OVER-SIGHTS.
REGARDING OPERATIONS' PRIORITIES, RESTORES AND RECOVERIES ARE DONE FIRST.
STORE JOBS ARE NEXT, WHILE PRINTING AND CARDS ARE DONE LAST.  WE HAVE FOUND
THAT BY USING THESE GUIDELINES FOR ASSIGNING PRIORITIES OUR "BATCH"
THROUGHPUT IS MAXIMIZED FOR ALL USERS IN GENERAL.

       IT WILL BE HELPFUL WHEN ENTERING A PPR IF THE REQUESTOR HAS SOME
KNOWLEDGE OF OPERATIONS' PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES.

BACKUP PROCEDURE:  EACH DAY AT SHUTDOWN TIME BEFORE THE HOST IS TAKEN DOWN,
A PARTIAL FILE SAVE OF THE DISK IS TAKEN ON MAG TAPE.  ALL FILES
ON THE DISK WHICH WERE EITHER CREATED,MODIFIED, OR WRITTEN OVER
ON THAT DAY WILL BE STORED ON A TAPE WITH A NUMBER FOR THAT DAY.  THE
TAPES ARE KEPT FOR ONE MONTH BEFORE THEY ARE RE-INITIALIZED FOR THE 
NEXT MONTH.

ALL FILES PROCEDURE:  EVERY TWO WEEKS OPERATIONS PERFORMS AN ENTIRE
FILE DIRECTORY SAVE FOR EACH USER ON EACH HOST COMPUTER.  THE TAPES WHICH
ARE USED ARE CALLED ALL FILES TAPES.  NOTE THAT BACKUPS AUGMENT
THIS PROCEDURE SINCE THEY FILL IN ALL THE GAPS AS FAR AS CHANGED FILES
ARE CONCERNED FOR EACH USER DURING THE TIME PERIODS BETWEEN ALL FILES.
OPERATIONS USES SIX SETS OF ALL FILES TAPES WHICH ARE ROTATED.
THIS ALLOWS FOR UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF FILE RECOVERY CAPABILITY.

SENDING OF SYSTEM MAIL:  WHEN A PPR IS COMPLETED BY THE SYSTEM OPERATOR,
MAIL IS SENT TO THE USER WHO MADE THE REQUEST.  THE USER MAY SPECIFY ANY
DIRECTORY NAME TO WHICH MAIL WILL BE SENT.  TO SEND MAIL TO OPERATIONS,
USE THE "SEND" COMMAND AND THE USER NAME "OPER".  MAIL WHICH IS SENT TO
THE SYSTEM OPERATOR GETS CLEARED BY THE BATCH CONTROLLER.

       THERE ARE SIX JOB TYPES THAT OPERATIONS CAN PERFORM VIA A PPR.

       TYPE 1  PRINTING  (SEE NOTE AT END OF SECTION)
       TYPE 2  CARD TO DISK
       TYPE 3  DISK TO CARD
       TYPE 4  TAPE TO DISK
       TYPE 5  DISK TO TAPE
       TYPE 6  TAPE CONVERSIONS.

PRINTING OF FILES WILL SOON BE DONE THROUGH A NEW MECHANISM.
A PRINTING "SPOOLER" PACKAGE  IS EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED IN THE
SPRING.  THE PROGRAM WILL BE COMPLETLY DOCUMENTED FOR EASY USE.

       CARDS TO BE READ INTO THE TYMSHARE SYSTEM ARE SENT OR DELIVERED
TO THE COMPUTER CENTER BY THE REQUESTOR.  PRIOR TO SUCH A DELIVERY, THE 
USER SHOULD HAVE ENTERED A BATCH REQUEST SAYING THAT THE CARDS WILL BE 
SENT, THEN THE REQUESTOR MAY ENCLOSE, WITH THE CARDS, TERMINAL OUTPUT
SHOWING THE PROGRAM "BATCH" BEING RUN.  NOTHING IS BETTER THAN THAT TTY
OUTPUT.  ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION IS ASKED BY THE BATCH PROGRAM.  DATE, NAME
PHONE NUMBER, COMPANY NAME, ETC ARE ALL THERE FOR ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION BY
OPERATIONS.  IF THIS CAN'T BE DONE, THEN THE REQUESTOR SHOULD HAVE AN
ENCLOSURE WITH THE CARDS WITH THE BATCH REQUEST NUMBER, THE COMPANY,
AND THE TELEPHONE NUMBER.  CARD DECKS SHOULD BE LABELED ON THE DECK AND
A DIAGONAL LINE DRAWN ACCROSS THE TOP OF THE DECK FROM CORNER TO CORNER.
OPERATIONS SHOULD ALSO BE INFORMED AS TO THE DISPOSITION OF THE CARDS.
STANDARD POLICY IS TO HOLD THE CARDS FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN DESTROY THEM.
CARDS ARE READ INTO THE SYSTEM IN THE EARLY MORNING BY GRAVE SHIFT.
IF A CUSTOMER WISHES TO HAVE CARDS PUNCHED ON SPECIAL STOCK, OPERATIONS WILL
DO THIS IF THE SPECIAL STOCK IS PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER.
WHETHER READING OR PUNCHING CARDS FORMAT TYPE (026  OR  029) MUST BE SPECIFIED.
THE TREATMENT OF TRAILING BLANKS MUST ALSO BE SPECIFIED ON CARDS BEING READ.

       JOB TYPE 4 FALLS INTO TWO CATEGORIES: RESTORING A FILE(S) FROM A
CUSTOMER TAPE AND RECOVERING A FILE(S) FROM AN ALL FILES OR BACKUP TAPE.
WHEN A REQUEST IS MADE TO RESTORE A FILE FROM A CUSTOMER TAPE THE USER
SHOULD BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE TRP NUMBER AND THE TID NUMBER ON THE REQUEST.
THIS WAY OPERATIONS KNOWS EXACTLY WHICH TAPE (MANY CUSTOMERS HAVE MORE THAN
ONE TAPE IN THE LIBRARY) TO USE.  UNLESS THE USER SPECIFIES DIFFERENTLY,
THE FILE(S) WILL BE RESTORED TO THE DIRECTORY OF THE USER WHO ENTERED
THE PPR.  IF THE FILE IS STORED ON THE CUSTOMER'S TAPE MORE THAN ONCE,
OPERATIONS WILL ALWAYS GET THE LATEST VERSION OF THE FILE, UNLESS THE
PPR SPECIFIES DIFFERENTLY.
       RECOVERING A FILE FROM A BACKUP OR ALL FILES TAPE IS A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT MATTER THAN JUST A SIMPLE RESTORE.  THE USER SHOULD BE
ABLE TO SAY AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY WHEN THE FILE WAS LAST UPDATED.  SOME
USERS KEEP TRACK AND THEREFORE CAN SAY THE EXACT DATE OF AN UPDATE FOR
A PARTICULAR FILE.  AT ANY RATE, THERE ARE MANY BACKUP TAPES AND ALL
FILES TAPES TO LOOK THROUGH, AND IF THE OPERATOR KNOWS THE UPDATE DATE,
OR THE CREATION DATE OF A FILE, HE CAN RECOVER IT MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN IF
HE HAS TO LOOK THROUGH TWO WEEKS OF BACKUP TAPES.  IF A FILE WHICH A 
CUSTOMER WANTS RECOVERED HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN A LONG TIME, (FOR INSTANCE
AN IML DESCRIPTION FILE), THEN IT WOULD BE WISE TO SAY SO ON THE PPR AND
TELL THE OPERATOR THAT THE FILE CAN BE RECOVERED FROM ANY ALL FILES
TAPE.  A FILE TO BE RECOVERED FROM A PARTICULAR DAY, (A WEEKLY REPORT
FOR INSTANCE), IS EASILY RECOVERED IF THE DATE OF UPDATE/CREATION IS GIVEN.

       STORING FILES ON TAPE, JOB TYPE 5, IS EASILY DONE AS LONG AS
THE TRP NUMBER AND TID NUMBER FOR THE PROPER TAPE IS SUBMITTED.  IT
HELPS TOO IF THE FILE DIRECTORY WHICH CONTAINS THE FILE IS GIVEN.
IF WHILE STORING FILES ON TAPE THE CUSTOMER'S TAPE BECOMES FULL, THEN
OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE WITH A NEW TAPE, ASSIGN A NEW TRP AND TID NUMBER
TO IT AND ADVISE THE CUSTOMER THAT A NEW TAPE WAS ASSIGNED.  THE CUSTOMER CAN
OF COURSE SUPPLY HIS OWN TAPE IF SO DESIRED.  A FEATURE WORTH NOTING HERE IS
THAT A TAPE DIRECTORY OF ANY TAPE CAN BE MADE TO A FILE AND PLACED IN A
DIRECTORY SO THE USER CAN SEE WHAT IS ON A TAPE OR TAPES WHICH BELONG
TO HIM.  FILES ARE ALWAYS STORED TWICE ON TAPE AS AN ADDED SECURITY MEASURE.

       TAPE CONVERSIONS, JOB TYPE 6, ARE USUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT TO
PERFORM OF ALL JOB TYPES.  IN ORDER TO CONVERT A TAPE MUCH INFORMATION IS
NEEDED SO IT CAN BE DONE THE FIRST TIME.  FREQUENTLY, ERRONEOUS INFORMA-
TION IS GIVEN, OR NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION IS GIVEN TO CONVERT A TAPE AND
WHEN THIS OCCURS THE PPR IS SENT TO CUSTOMER SERVICES WHO MUST CALL THE USER
AND FIND OUT THE NECESSARY INFORMATION.  THIS RESULTS IN A DELAY IN PROCESSING.
THE INFORMATION WHICH WE NEED TO EASILY AND CORRECTLY CONVERT A TAPE IS:

       DENSITY  (1600,800,556,200)
       TRACKS  (7 OR 9)
       PARITY  (ODD  OR  EVEN)
       CODE  (BCD,ASCII,ETC.)
       NUMBER OF CHARACTERS PER RECORD
       BLOCKING FACTOR  
       HEADER INFORMATION  
       NUMBER OF TAPE FILES

       THE FOLLOWING SECTION DEALS WITH GUIDELINES FOR ENTERING A PPR.
IF IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HAVE RUN THE PROGRAM "BATCH" THEN TYPE
THE WORD "HELP" AT THE PROMPT ":" CHARACTER.  THIS COMMAND TELLS EXACTLY
HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM, PLUS THE PROGRAM'S CAPABILITIES.  SUBMITTING ONE
JOB TYPE PER PPR IS BETTER THAN TWO OR THREE TYPES SINCE EXECUTION TIME
IS DECREASED.  FOR INSTANCE, A REQUEST TO RESTORE A FILE FROM A CUSTOMER
TAPE AND TO READ IN A DECK OF CARDS (WHICH MORE THAN LIKELY ARE IN TRANSIT
TO THE  COMPUTER CENTER), IS NOT A GOOD IDEA SINCE THE RESTORE MAY NOT BE
DONE UNTIL THE CARDS ARRIVE.  TWO REQUESTS ARE BETTER THAN ONE!
ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS ASKED BY THE PROGRAM.  YOUR NAME, COMPANY NAME, PHONE NUM-
BER AND PROJECT CODE ARE IMPORTANT.  TWO OTHER QUESTIONS, "DESCRIPTION OF
WORK" AND "DELIVERY INSTRUCIONS" ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK
IS A FREE FORM QUESTION WHICH ALLOWS A USER THE SPACE TO GIVE AS MUCH
PERTINENT INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE FOR THE REQUEST.  HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES:
       TO RESTORE A FILE FROM A CUSTOMER TAPE:  "PLEASE RESTORE A FILE
CALLED /FILENAME/ FROM TAPE TRP #A42, TID #1788, TO MY DIRECTORY.
THE FILES WAS PREVIOUSLY STORED ON MY TAPE MARCH 3."

       TO RECOVER A FILE FROM A BACKUP TAPE:  "PLEASE RECOVER A FILE CALLED
/FILENAME/ FROM BACKUP TAPES.  THE FILE WAS LAST UPDATED ON MARCH 3."

       TO RECOVER A FILE FROM ALL FILES:  "PLEASE RECOVER FILE CALLED 
/FILENAME/ FROM YOUR ALL FILES TAPES.  THE FILE HAS NOT BEEN 
UPDATED IN THE LAST MONTH"  (THIS WAY THE OPERATOR KNOWS THAT THE FILE IS
NOT GOING TO BE ON A BACKUP TAPE, AND THAT A VERSION OF THE FILE FROM ANY
ALL FILES TAPES WILL BE ALRIGHT)
       DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS APPLY WHEN EITHER A LISTING OR A TAPE OR
CARDS ARE TO BE SENT TO THE REQUESTOR.  A COMPLETE ADDRESS IS ALL THAT IS
NEEDED.  TAPES AND LISTING ARE SENT FIRST CLASS IF NOTHING IS SPECIFIED.
HOWEVER, WE WILL SEND LISTINGS AND TAPES OR CARDS BY ANY METHOD THAT THE USER
SPECIFIES.  SOME SPECIAL HANDLING IS NECESSARY FOR OUTPUT WHICH IS NEEDED
IMMEDIATELY BY THE USER AND WE DO OUR BEST TO ACCOMODATE THE USER.
SOME USERS SIMPLY USE THE DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS TO ASK TO HAVE MAIL
(SYSTEM MAIL) SENT TO THEM WHEN THE REQUEST IS COMPLETED.
IF A USER IS NOT EXACTLY SURE OF HOW TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING HE WANTS
DONE OR WISHES TO FIND OUT IF OPERATIONS WILL SEND SOMETHING A CERTAIN WAY
THEN HE SHOULD FEEL FREE TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICES IN LIEU OF ENTERING A
CONFUSING PPR.

       MISCELLANEOUS
HOW LONG WILL REQUESTS TAKE TO DO?  RESTORES AND RECOVERIES ARE 
DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALMOST ALL SUCH JOBS SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN
FOUR HOURS.  THE LENGTH OF TIME IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO SYSTEM LOAD, AND
THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS PENDING FOR THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM.  IF POSSIBLE
ENTER THE REQUEST SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY NEED THE FILE.
STORE JOBS MAY TAKE UP TO EIGHT HOURS TO COMPLETE.  LISTINGS ARE USUALLY
DONE ON SWING SHIFT.  IF THE REQUEST IS ENTERED BY 1500, THE LISTING(S)
WILL BE AVAILABLE THE FOLLOWING MORNING.  CARD JOBS (PUNCHING AND READING)
ARE DONE ON GRAVE SHIFT AND WILL THEREFORE TAKE AS LONG AS 24 HOURS.

       AS FAR AS OPERATIONS IS CONCERNED, ALL BATCH PROCESSING JOBS
ARE "RUSH" JOBS.  IF A CUSTOMER ACCIDENTALLY DELETES A FILE HE NEEDS TO
RUN A PROGRAM AND HE IS ALL SET TO RUN THEN OBVIOUSLY HE WOULD LIKE THE FILE
RESTORED WITHIN AS SHORT A TIME AS POSSIBLE.  THIS IS BEST ACHIEVED
BY CALLING THE CUSTOMER SERVICES GROUP WHO IN TURN WILL ASK OPERATIONS TO PUT
A "RUSH" ON A PARTICULAR JOB.  ONLY CUSTOMER SERVICES CAN PUT A "RUSH"
ON A JOB.  
       SOMETIMES USERS WILL ENTER A BATCH REQUEST TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF
A JOB, OR TO ASK SOME OTHER QUESTION.  THESE ARE NOT PROPER JOB TYPES AND
THEREFORE THE BATCH PROGRAM SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SUCH PURPOSES.  A CALL
TO THE CENTER, OR SYSTEM MAIL IS MUCH BETTER.
       THE TAPE LIBRARY SYSTEM ALLOWS A CUSTOMER THE OPTION TO PURCHASE
A TAPE FOR HIS OWN USE AND HAVE OPERATIONS TAKE CARE OF THE TAPE.  A TAPE
CAN BE REQUESTED BY A USER JUST BY ENTERING A BATCH REQUEST SAYING THAT
HE WOULD LIKE A TAPE SET UP FOR HIS USE.  OPERATIONS WILL THEN ASSIGN
A TAPE, PERFORM THE WORK ON THE REQUEST AND INFORM THE USER BY SYSTEM MAIL OF
HIS TRP AND TID NUMBER.
