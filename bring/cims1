This manual contains the procedures used at McDonnell Douglas Field Service
Company field offices for ordering and receiving spare parts, and for returning
defective parts.
.indent 8,8
New users of this manual should read the next page "How to 
Use this Manual."
.indent 8,8
An application software system called CIMS (Computer Inventory Management
System; pronounced "sims") is used at the depot/repair 
centers to manage the field
service spares inventory.
CIMS runs on a CSC 9000 computer.
The functions of CIMS are to:
.indent 13,18
-####Track parts movement from the 
depot/repair centers to the field offices
.indent 13,18
-####Track parts transfers between field offices
.indent 13,18
-####Track returns of defective parts to the depot/repair centers
.indent 13,18
-####Replenish field office inventories automatically
.indent 8,8
Field office personnel do not use CIMS directly, but fill out forms
that are sent to the depot/repair center for data entry.

_########OVERVIEW OF CIMS
.indent 8,8
Spare parts for field offices are controlled by
three depot/repair centers using application software called CIMS
(Computer Inventory Management System).
A diagram of the system appears on the next page.
.indent 8,8
REPAIRABLE PARTS
.indent 8,8
Each spare part needed by a field office is assigned a planned quantity
based on the types of equipment and population serviced by the field office.
Whenever a field office uses a repairable part, the defective part
is removed and sent to the depot/repair center with a Field Service
Transfer/Returned Goods Shipper and DMT (Defective Material Tag).
The information from these forms is entered into CIMS.
This parts usage is tracked by CIMS and the field office's on-hand
quantity for the part is debited each time a defective part is received
by the depot/repair center.
.indent 8,8
Also, whenever one field office sends a part to another field office,
a copy of the Field Service Transfer/Returned Goods Shipper form is sent 
to the depot/repair center.
The information from this form is entered into CIMS.
This parts movement is tracked by CIMS and the sending office's on-hand 
quantity is debited and the receiving office's on-hand quantity 
is credited.
.indent 8,8
The field offices monthly receive the Planned and Actual Inventory Levels
Report (FSINV030).
This report shows the planned and actual quantities for each repairable
part.
.indent 8,8
Weekly, a "one-for-one" replenishment program is run that
checks the field office's parts usage and transfers.
The program compares the current on-hand for the part to the 
planned on-hand.
If the program finds that the field office's current on-hand quantity
is below its planned quantity, a Field Service Shipper form is generated.
This form shows the part number and the quantity that needs
to be shipped to replenish the field office and bring its 
on-hand back up to planned.
The program automatically considers plug-compatible parts (explained below)
for replenishment.
The depot/repair center sends parts
with the Field Service Shipper to the field office.
If the field office's quantity on-hand is equal to or greater than
the planned quantity, the Field Service Shipper shows a zero quantity
to be shipped.
.indent 8,8
If the depot/repair center cannot ship one of the parts because it 
is out of stock,
the part is backordered, and Field Service Shippers are generated
weekly until the backorder is filled and the part is shipped.
Since the Field Service Shipper
shows backordered quantities, the field office is kept
informed of backorders.

.next page
.indent 8,8
EXPENDABLE PARTS
.indent 8,8
CIMS does not track
expendable parts usage in the same way as for 
repairable parts.
The field office monitors the stock of each expendable part
and reorders when necessary.
Each field office receives the Monthly Expendable Parts Usage Report
which shows the month-to-date and year-to-date purchases
by the field office for each expendable part.
.indent 8,8
INITIAL SPARES
.indent 8,8
Initial spares part selection is based on the system configuration including
the CPU, terminals, and peripheral devices.
.indent 8,8
PLUG-COMPATIBLE PARTS
.indent 8,8
Plug-compatible parts are parts that are made by different manufacturers
that are interchangeable.
The parts may be made by different manufacturers and have different part
numbers, but are of the same form, fit, and function.
.indent 8,8
In CIMS, the terms provisioning parts and substitute parts (subs) are
used to refer
to plug-compatible parts.
For related plug-compatible parts, one of the parts is provisioning part
and the other parts (called substitute parts) "point" to the provisioning
part.
Provisioning parts are usually manufactured by the vendor of the model 
or system.
.INDENT 8,8
In some cases, a sub may only be "upward-compatible" (that is, only
plug-compatible for later releases of the same part, but not 
plug-compatible for earlier releases of the same part).
.next page
.indent 8,8
FILLING OUT FORMS
.indent 8,8
The forms must be filled out completely as described in this manual.
All data entry (including transfers between field offices)
is done through the Material Support data entry departments, so it is 
important that personnel accurately and completely fill out all
documents and forward them to the appropriate depot/repair 
center for processing.
If forms are are not completely filled out, the field office's
inventory is not updated correctly.
.indent 8,8
LOCATION CODES
.indent 8,8
Each field office that stocks spare parts is assigned with a three to five
position "location code."
This is the code by which CIMS recognizes a field office.
A typical location code is "BAL" for Baltimore, MD or
"MLU"
for Monroe, LA.
Some of the larger offices have been split into two separate locations,
and to differentiate between their location codes, additional characters
have been added
to the original code to indicate the newer office.
.indent 8,8
Third-party field offices have a "T" in the fourth position and
Tymnet field offices have an "N" in the fourth position.
.indent 8,8
You can only transfer parts to a "like" location.
For example, you cannot transfer parts from a CSC location to a third-party
location (such as BOS to BDLT1).
Tymnet parts can only be transferred to other Tymnet locations;
CSC parts can only be transferred to other CSC locations;
and third-party parts can only be transferred to other third-party locations.
.indent 8,8
FREIGHT CARRIERS
.indent 8,8
Emery Worldwide is the offical carrier of FSC:
.indent 13,18
-####All offices returning material to the depot/repair centers 
must mark "Day 2"
service on the Emery freight bill
.indent 13,18
-####All material is shipped from the depot/repair centers Emery "PM"
unless the office ordering the parts requests "AM" service
.indent 13,18
-####Use another commmerical carrier if it better suits your needs
and if it is more cost-effective (such as when transferring parts within
your region)
.next page
.indent 8,8
INDEX FILE
.indent 8,8
At each field office, personnel keep track of the local inventory through
an index card file system and a card rack with slots.
Each repairable part and tool has a corresponding index card.
.indent 8,8
Parts currently in stock are kept in the "area stock" section of the
file.
When an FE takes a part, the corresponding index card is moved
to a slot in the card rack with the FE's name.
When the part is installed in the customer's machine and the defective 
part is sent to the depot/repair center, the card is
moved to the "suspense" section of the file.
When the part is received in a replenishment shipment, the card is moved from 
the suspense section back to the area stock section of the file.

CHANGES IN POLICY AND PROCEDURE - FORMER MICOMS USERS
.indent 8,8
With the conversion from MICOMS to CIMS, the third-party field offices
have several changes in policy.
.indent 8,13
1.###The field offices can no longer obtain Purchase Orders for 
purchases from their local vendors.
All purchases must be made through the depot/repair centers.
.indent 13,13
An exception is made for expendable parts.
Expendable parts may be purchased locally by reporting the
expense on a Weekly Expense Voucher.
.indent 8,13
2.###The field offices can no longer obtain Purchase Orders for 
repair of parts by local repair vendors.
All defective parts must be sent to the depot/repair center.
.indent 8,13
3.###DMTs are now used instead of DPTs.
However, until the existing stock of DPTs is exhausted,
continue to use the DPTs, but only fill in the fields
that are the same as on the DMT.
.indent 8,13
4.###Field offices cannot repair parts at their field offices.
All defective parts are now returned to the depot/repair center.
.indent 8,13
5.###Expendable parts are ordered by using a MOF or EPOF and sending it to
the Atlanta depot.
.indent 8,13
6.###Initial spares are ordered by following the procedure on 
page 39.
.indent 8,13
7.###Tools are ordered with a MOF that is sent to the Irvine depot.
.indent 8,8
CHANGES IN POLICY AND PROCEDURE - FORMER MENTRY USERS
.indent 8,8
With the conversion from Mentry to CIMS, the Tymnet field offices
have several changes in policy.
.indent 8,13
1.###Parts and tools stocked at the King of Prussia depot/repair center
may be  ordered through the Field Service Master Program
(page 31).
However, emergency orders must be phoned to another field office or to the

This procedure is used when an FE goes on a service call and needs
a part to repair a customer's machine.
.indent 8,13
1.###Go to customer site.
.indent 8,13
2.###If a part is needed and you do not have it with you,
call your field office and ask if the part is in stock there.
.indent 13,18
A.###If the part is on-hand:
.indent 18,23
-####Go to the field office to pick up part.
.indent 18,23
.preface 0
-####Move the inventory card from the area stock section of the 
index file to the FE slot.
.indent 18,23
-####Go to step 3.
.preface 1
.indent 13,18
B.###If the part is not on-hand at the field office:
.indent 18,23
-####Locate the part by using the Dispatch Part Status function (page 34).
If the part is not available in your region, then call the appropriate
depot and they will locate the part for you.
.indent 23,23
Any category "A" order (emergency) placed through a 
depot/repair center requires 
a system serial number and an open incident
number from Central Dispatch before the order can be processed
(except for Tymnet parts).
.indent 18,23
-####When the part is received, pull a matching card from the suspense
file.
On the next available line under "RECEIVED" enter the serial number, date,
and your initials.
.indent 18,23
-####Place the inventory card in the FE slot.
.indent 18,23
-####Sign and mail the gold copy of the shipper to the 
appropriate depot to
