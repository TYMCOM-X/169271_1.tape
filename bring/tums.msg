-----------------------------------------------------------------------


In recent months there has been a steady decline in the number
of "P-2" (Initial Spares) and "P-3" (Replenishment) orders coming
from the field.  Accompanying this has been a rather substantial
increase in the number of "P-1" (Emergency, Machine Down) orders,
some of which have been for expendables.  Ordering parts P-1 is
very costly and inefficient.  It should be reserved for real
emergencies.  It has come to our attention that the current 
feeling is that ordering parts P-1 is the only way to obtain
them in a timely manner.  This is not the case.  Here are some
guidelines to insure that your spares orders are filled effectively.

1.  Plan Ahead:  Inventory levels, especially for expendables,
should be routinely monitored by those responsible for each respective
site or district.  You should plan on an 8 - 12 week turnaround on
routine orders from the date we receive them.  Some items may take
longer because of vendor lead times, so feel free to contact us
about any items in question.  Regularly scheduled P.M.'s should
be figured into this process.

2.  Paperwork:  Another way to insure prompt spares replenishment
is to complete all necessary paperwork.  If you have questions, feel
free to contact us prior to submitting the order.  On P-2 orders,
be sure to attach an Initial Spares Cover Letter.  All MOF's should
be accompanied by travelers.  Always include model numbers and the
manufacturer, along with your name, phone, etc. so that we may contact 
you in case we are unclear about what is needed.

We have taken steps to streamline the parts ordering process.  Fewer
signatures are needed and approval of legitimate orders is much
easier to obtain.  We encourage and appreciate any suggestions from
the field.  We are confident that we can provide you with the parts

support you desire, and together we will continue to grow and prosper.

SEPTEMBER 20, 1985  
     
     
TO:      ALL FIELD OPERATIONS LOCATIONS 
     
FROM:    CURT MILLER, VP-FIELD OPERATIONS    
     
SUBJECT: REDUCTION IN FORCE   
     
PLEASE SEE THAT THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM VERN HART, PRES-FIELD  
OPERATIONS, IS POSTED AND/OR DISTRIBUTED:    
     
     
DEAR FIELD SERVICE COMPANY EMPLOYEE:    
     
WHEN YOU WORK FOR A COMPANY, PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING 
THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IS A REDUCTION IN FORCE.  THE LOSS OF A JOB, OR
THE THREAT OF IT, IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER TO EVERYONE.
     
MANY OF YOU HAVE MADE USE OF "OPEN LINE" TO EXPRESS YOUR CONCERNS AND 
TO ASK QUESTIONS.  I WISH TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO HAVE DONE SO AND TO  
EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR SHARING YOUR FEELINGS.  EACH QUESTION OR  
CONCERN WILL BE ANSWERED INDIVIDUALLY AND, IN ADDITION, THE RESPONSES 
WILL BE SUMMARIZED IN COMPANY PUBLICATIONS FOR THE INFORMATION OF ALL.
     
SINCE THIS INFORMATION WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, I WILL   
NOT, IN THIS LETTER, ADDRESS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE RECEIVED
EITHER THROUGH "OPEN LINE" OR IN PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS.  MY PURPOSE  
HERE IS TO SKETCH OUT FOR YOU THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
NEED FOR A REDUCTION IN FORCE AND THEN TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON WHERE WE ARE    
GOING AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING TO GET THERE.
     
THE PRESENT BUSINESS SLUMP IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS CERTAINLY NOT  
NEWS TO ANYONE.  IT BEGAN TO DEVLOP LATE LAST YEAR AND HAD GROWN TO   
SERIOUS PROPORTIONS BY THE SECOND QUARTER.  ALL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS
HAVE EXPERIENCED ITS EFFECTS, INCLUDING IBM, DEC, ATT-IS, HEWLETT
PACKARD, DATA GENERAL, AND WANG.  ALL HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEIR 1985 PLANS  
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  MANY HAVE TAKEN COST REDUCTION ACTIONS RANGING
FROM REDUCED WORK WEEKS AND PERIODIC SHUT DOWNS TO REDUCED WAGES,
REDUCTIONS IN FORCE, AND PLANT CLOSINGS.
     
A KEY PART OF THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ISG STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DIVERSIFY
ITS OPERATIONS BY ESTABLISHING ELEVEN BUSINESS UNITS WHICH, BY WORKING
TOGETHER, WILL ADDESS A MULTIPLICITY OF MARKETS.  IN A NORMAL YEAR, THE    
EXPECTATION IS THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF UNITS MIGHT HAVE A RELATIVELY   
WEAK PERFORMANCE BUT THAT THIS WOULD BE OFFSET BY STRONG PERFORMANCES OF   
THE OTHERS.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE OVERALL RESULTS FOR ISG IN THE SECOND  
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WERE EXAMINED IN JULY, THE REVERSE SITUATION WAS 
FOUND.  WHEREAS A FEW UNITS WERE DOING WELL, THE MAJORITY WERE FALLING
SHORT OF PLAN AND THE OUTLOOK WAS NOT GOOD.  
     
AS A RESULT, EACH BUSINESS UNIT, INCLUDING THE FIELD SERVICE COMPANY, 
WAS GIVEN A PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TARGET AND ASKED TO DEVELOP PLANS 
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  
     
EVEN THOUGH THE FIELD SERVICE COMPANY WAS ON PLAN THROUGH THE END OF  
JUNE, IT WAS APPARENT THAT OUR PLANNED REVENUE GOALS FOR THE LAST HALF
OF THE YEAR, WOULD FALL WELL SHORT OF PLAN.  WE CLEARLY COULD NOT AFFORD   
TO SPEND ON THE CURRENT RATE, AND THEREFORE, THE ELIMINATION OR  
SIGNIFICANT CURTAILMENT OF ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS WHICH WERE NOT    
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESS, BECOME NECESSARY.  WE ALSO FOUND
THAT NORMAL BELT TIGHTENING WOULD NOT PRODUCE THE REQUIRED RESULTS TO 
MEET OUR NEW GOALS AND THEREFORE, A REDUCTION IN FORCE BECAME NECESSARY.   
     
IT IS MY VIEW THAT THE ACTIONS TAKEN, THOUGH PAINFUL, WERE A NECESSARY
CORRECTION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WILL KEEP US ON COURSE TOWARDS 
OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF BECOMING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO THE OTHER    
ISG BUSINESS UNITS. 
     
MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE REDUCTION IN FORCE, HAVE, QUITE   
NATURALLY, EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO WERE AND FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE   
WITH THE COMPANY.  LET ME SAY THAT I KNOW OF NO ONE IN MANAGEMENT WHO 
WILL CONTEMPLATE A REDUCTION IN FORCE WITH ANYTHING BUT THE GREATEST  
RELUCTANCE.  I KNOW I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE SENIOR STAFF AS WELL AS MYSELF  
WHEN I SAY THAT.  AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL TODAY, THE FORCE REDUCTION WE 
HAVE JUST MADE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO THE PRESENT NEED.  THAT IS NOT TO
SAY THAT CONTINUED ACTIONS WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE SALES AND 
CONTROL COSTS.  QUITE THE CONTRARY IS TRUE.  TO ACHIEVE OUR TARGETS, THE   
COMING MONTHS WILL REQUIRE EXTRA EFFORTS AND ELIMINATION OF ALL  
UNNECESSARY COSTS.  I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL MAKE THOSE EFFORTS AND
THAT OUR COST CONTROLS WILL BE EFFECTIVE.    
     
WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED AT THIS TIME IN DETAILED PLANNING FOR 1986.  MOST 
INDUSTRY OPINION SUPPORTS A VIEW OF A CONTINUATION OF SLOW COMPUTER   
SALES THROUGH AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF 1986.   THEREFORE, WE ARE    
DEVELOPING PLANS WHICH TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND WILL CAREFULLY CONTROL   
OUR GROWTH TO MITIGATE AGAINST ANY FURTHER NEED FOR A FORCE REDUCTION.
     
FOR THE LONGER TERM, I BELIEVE WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE    
OF THE UPTURN WHEN IT HAPPENS.  BY THE END OF THE DECADE, OUR TARGET IS    
TO AT LEAST DOUBLE OUR REVENUES THROUGH EXPANDED SALES TO OTHER ISG   
BUSINESS UNITS AND TO ADDITIONAL OEM CUSTOMERS.   
     
IN EARLY 1986, ALMOST ALL OF MANAGEMENT WILL BE ENGAGED-ONE WAY OR ANOTHER-
WITH HELPING TO DEVELOP A LONG-RANGE BUSINESS STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE OUR 
GOAL OF PROFITABLE GROWTH.  ESSENTIAL TO THAT STRATEGY IS THE INVOLVEMENT  
OF EVERYONE IN THE QUEST FOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS THROUGH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.    
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE ONLY COMPANIES WHO CAN PROVIDE LONG-TERM   
EMPLOYMENT ARE THOSE WHO CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY PROFITABLE.  IN OUR HIGHLY    
COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY, THE SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES WILL BE THOSE WHO FOCUS ON  
QUALITY, WHO DELIVER PRODUCTS WHICH CONFORM EXACTLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS,   
ARE COMPETITIVELY PRICED, ARE DELIVERED AS COMMITTED AND ARE PROFESSIONALLY
SERVICED. 
     
WITH YOUR HELP, I BELIEVE WE WILL MAKE OUR COMPANY A GREAT SUC

Subject:  ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETINS (AB's)



1.  The following guidelines are established regarding the use 
    of AB's within ISG:

          Administrative Bulletins (AB's) will be used 
          throughout ISG as the means of announcing organization 
          changes, promotions, new or revised policies requiring 
          immediate implementation and other administrative 
          matters of substantial importance.  Two types of AB's 
          will be used:

          -   ISG AB's - Issued by ISG HQ/Group Staff

          -   ISG Company AB's -  Issued by ISG Business 
                                  Units/Organizations reporting 
                                  directly to the Group 
                                  Executive Officer or the Group 
                                  Operating Officer.

          All AB's should be drafted on the appropriate AB form, 
          signed by a Director or higher level and ready for 
          issuance (excluding AB number and date) and forwarded 
          to the issuing organization.  All ISG AB's involving 
          policy will require ISG-HQ signature.  All company 
          AB's involving policy will require signature of 
          Company Head.  AB's which identify newly assigned or 
          revised reporting relationships should include the 
          signature of the principal to whom these personnel 
          will report.

          The issuing organization will assure that all position 
          titles used in the AB are correct and will verify with 
          Human Resources that all announcements of promotions 
          or other title changes have been approved prior to 
          release of the AB.

          AB distribution should be customized whenever feasible

duplicate postage expense.

Subject:  FORMATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ELECTRONIC MESSAGING 
          SYSTEMS COMPANY



I am pleased to announce the formation of the McDonnell Douglas 
Electronic Messaging Systems Company.  MDEMS combines two 
existing businesses, FTCC and OnTyme, to aggressively pursue a 
larger share of the Electronic Messaging Market.  Combined 
revenue of FTCC and OnTyme in 1985 is $30 Million and the 
planned 1986 revenue goal for MDEMS is $40 Million.  This new 
unit will be a product organization and will rely on other ISG 
business units for the distribution of its products.

One key element of the 1986 MDEMS sales plan is to encourage all 
ISG business units to sell these messaging products.  At the 
present time, the bulk of the messaging revenue originates from 
the Diversified Systems Company and FTC Communications.  These 
organizations will continue to aggressively sell these products, 
but MDEMS will begin working with the other business units to 
adapt the products to their markets.

During the remainder of 1985, the MDEMS organization structure, 
business plan and 1986 financial operating plan will be 
developed to enable us to implement our messaging business 
strategy.

MDEMS will be managed by Terry Donaher, Vice President of 
Network Applications for the business and Network Systems 
Company and will report to Warren Prince, President of McDonnell 
Douglas Business and Network Systems Company.

I sincerely regret to announce the resignation of Gary E. Liebl, 
currently the Group Operating Officer of the Information Systems 
Group, effective Thursday, October 17, 1985.

Gary has accepted an appointment as President, Chief Operating 
Officer and member of the Board of Cipher Data Products, Inc., 
of San Diego, California, a leading supplier of magnetic tape 
peripherals and controllers.

During the time we worked together as ISG executive board 
members and, since June, as the team leading the ISG, I have 
developed great respect for his capabilities and for him as a 
person.  He will be greatly missed, and I am sure we all wish 
him much success in the future.

Prior to his present ISG position, Gary was President of 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company and President of 
Microdata Corporation.  Gary was also appointed a Corporate Vice 
President of MDC in July 1983.

Gary's departure makes necessary some alterations in the senior 
management structure of ISG; those changes will be announced in 
a few days.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Over the past few weeks, many of you have had questions about 
your new health benefits.  The most frequently asked questions 
are answered here to help everyone understand these new plans.  
Other questions may be referred to your Human Resources 
Department:
 
     Southern California             (714) 250-1000
                                      Ext. 2184 or 2239

GENERAL AMERICAN PLAN
 
 
WHEN ARE MY ISG BENEFITS EFFECTIVE?
 
If you were an ISG employee prior to 9/30/85, your benefits 
become effective 9/30/85.  If you were disabled or on a leave of 
absence on that date, your coverage will be delayed until you 
return to work.
 
 
I HAVE A DEPENDENT WHO WAS HOSPITALIZED ON 9/30/85.  IS MY 
DEPENDENT COVERED UNDER THE OLD PLAN OR THE NEW PLAN?
 
                                                                Page  2

If a dependent was confined in a hospital or convalescent nursing 
home prior to 9/30/85, he/she will be covered under the old plan 
until discharged.  The day after discharge, the dependent will be 
covered under the new plan.
 
 
DO I HAVE TO SATISFY AN ADDITIONAL 1985 ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE WITH 
GENERAL AMERICAN BEFORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE?
 
Deductible expenses incurred between 1/1/85 and 9/29/85 under 
your previous health plan apply toward General American's 1985 
deductible.  If the deductible on your previous plan was less 
than General American's, you will need to satisfy the difference.  
This information was sent by the previous carrier to General 
American on 9/30/85.
 
NOTE:  Under the General American Plan, deductible expenses 
incurred during October, November or December apply toward the 
following year's deductible.
 
 
WHAT DO I DO WITH BILLS INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85 THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN SUBMITTED?
 
All claims must be submitted to your previous carrier as soon as 
possible.  Send claims to:
 
     Former Tymshare/Tymnet employees:
 
          New Systems Inc.
          P.O. Box 11290
          San Francisco, CA.  94101
 
     Former Microdata employees:
 
          Northwestern National Life Insurance Company
          Regional Claims Center
          730 Fairmont Avenue - Suite 202
          Glendale, CA  91203
 
 
HOW WILL GENERAL AMERICAN KNOW ABOUT DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES I 
SUBMITTED AFTER 9/30/85 FOR EXPENSES INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85?
 
Keep your copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form which 
accompanies all claim payments.  Attach this form to claims you 
submit to General American so that you are credited with the 
proper deductible amount.
 
 
WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY PCS CARD?
 
Your PCS card(s) will be mailed by the end of October.  Until you 
receive your card, you must pay for the drug.  Keep the receipt 
which itemizes patient's name, doctor's name, prescription 
number, date, quantity dispensed and amount charged.  You will be 
reimbursed the charge for the drug, less the appropriate 
deductible ($1.50 or $3.00) by attaching the receipt to the PCS 
                                                                Page  3

claim form.  Claim forms are available from the Human Resources 
office.  This form requires information found only on your PCS 
card, so wait until you receive your card before submitting the 
form for reimbursement.  This procedure applies for drugs 
purchased for dependent children over age 19 or from non-
participating pharmacies.
 
 
HOW DO I FILL A PRESCRIPTION THROUGH THE MAIL ORDER OPTION?
 
You will receive a mail order form for the America's Pharmacy 
with your PCS card.  You may order by mail the amount prescribed 
by your doctor, up to a 6 month supply, by paying only one 
deductible.
 
 
WHO DOES MY DOCTOR/HOSPITAL CALL FOR VERIFICATION OF MY 
INSURANCE?
 
Call the MDC Group Insurance Office in St. Louis at
(314) 232-9181.
 
 
WHAT IF MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDS HOSPITALIZATION?

WHAT ABOUT EMERGENCY SITUATIONS?
 
Your doctor must call for certification within one working day 
after admission to the hospital.
 
 
WHEN MUST I OBTAIN A SECOND SURGICAL OPINION?
 
Unless you obtain a second opinion for some non-emergency 
surgical procedures, General American will pay half the amount it 
would normally pay for the surgeon's fees.  These procedures are 
listed on page 13 of Your Group Insurance summary plan 
description.
 
 
WHAT IF A NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY?
 
Second opinions are not required in emergency situations.
 
 
ARE THERE ANY SPECIAL CLAIM PROCEDURES?
 
Yes.  When you get a second opinion, get a special sticker for 
your claim form from the Group Insurance Office or your Human 
                                                                Page  4

Resources Office.  The doctor giving the second opinion must 
complete and sign the sticker for the second opinion to be paid 
at 100%.  Separate bills for tests related to the second opinion, 
require a similar sticker for reimbursement.
 
 
WILL I RECEIVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PRE-ADMISSION 
CERTIFICATION AND THE SECOND SURGICAL OPINION FEATURES?
 
A mailing was sent to all ISG employees which included brochures 
on Second Surgical Opinions, Pre-Admission Certification and 
General American Plan information card(s).  If you did not 
receive this information, please contact Human Resources.

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.

    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will continue to take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.

Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

1.  MDC  Standards,  Reference  (a),  provide a list of preferred
    hardware  and  software standards for office automation.  For
    ISG  use,  Reference (b), we are continuing with only the IBM
    Personal  Computer  (PC) and IBM Personal Computer XT (PC/XT)
    devices   for   automated  office  systems.    Enclosure  (1)
    provides   the  current  standard  configurations  for  these
    systems.

2.  Configurations  in Enclosure (1) have been updated to reflect
    new  software versions for Multimate (Advantage Version 3.6),
    Lotus  1-2-3  (Version  2),  and  DOS  (Version  3.1).    All
    existing  PC  and  PC/XT users will receive software upgrades
    for  these products in December 1985.  Update procedures will
    be announced by separate Administrative Bulletin.

3.  Lotus  Version 2 will not require use of the system diskette,
    provides    accelerated    calculations    using   the   math
    coprocessor,  and  provides  file  password capability. Lotus
    1-2-3  Aids  in  Enclosure  (1)  have  been  removed from the
    Preferred  Options  due  to these features now being provided
    by Lotus.

Subject:  Addition   to   Policy   5-MDC  section-ISG  Management
          Handbook



1.  Policy  5  in  the MDC section of the ISG Management Handbook
    discusses    the    HQ-authorized    manuals    which    have
    corporate-wide  applicability.    The appendix to this Policy
    contains a listing of those manuals.

2.  The   Corporate  Information  Resource  Management  Standards
    should be added to this appendix.

3.  The  purpose  of this manual is to disseminate Corporate-wide
    standards  for Information Resource Management principles and
    practices,   standards   for  systems  analysis  and  design,
    software,    equipment,    telecommunications,    information
    processing, systems integrity, and data administration.

4.  The  person responsible for development and revision of these
    standards  is  the  Director-Information  Resource Management
    Hardware/Software   Technology,   with  minimum  coordination
    required with the component IRM function heads.

5.  Distribution,  publication, and control of this manual is the
    responsibility  of  the  Manager-MDC  Procedures.    Approval
    resides  with  the  Staff Vice President-Information Resource
    Management.

6.  Other areas of the handbook remain unchanged.

7.  In  January  1986,  ISG Policy Management will distribute the
    quarterly  update  of the Management Handbook.  At that time,
    a  new  page  will  be  provided  to  update  the text in the
    Appendix  to  Policy  5 and include the Corporate Information
    Resource  Management Standards as a Corporate Manual.  In the
    interim,  please  make  a note of this change in your copy of
    the handbook.

APPARENTLY ALL THE MACHINES WERE NOT COUNTED DURING THE INVENTORY IN  
OCTOBER, THE COUNT IS APPROXIMATELY 1100 MACHINES SHORT.    
     
SO THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE WILL TAKE PLACE IMMEDIATELY. ATTACHED TO    
THIS ONTYME IS A LIST OF ALL THE NODES #'S THAT WERE 'NOT' COUNTED    
DURING THE INVENTORY. PER THIS LIST THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WILL    
BE SUPPLIED;   
                NODE#           SERIAL#         MACHINE TYPE
                ---------------------------------------------   
     
THIS INFORMATION WILL BE SUPPLIED FOR MANNED SITES BY WEDNESDAY NOV.  
27TH, 'ALL' OTHER SITES ARE DUE BY DEC. 3RD. THESE DATES ARE 'FIRM'   
NO EXTENSIONS OR EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE. THE INFORMATION WILL BE
GIVEN DIRECTLY TO CORP. FINANCE AND THERE ARE TWO (2) METHODS TO 
GET THE INFO TO THEM.    
     
1.  ONTYME PEGGY BOLLINGER (FIN.P/BOLLINGER) 
2. CALL DIRECTLY WITH INFO TO,  PEGGY BOLLINGER (408)446-7760    
                        OR      BARBARA MCINTYRE (408)446-6777    
     
THERE IS A SECOND METHOD OF LOCATING THE MISSING EQUIPMENT (SIC).
THERE IS A REPORT ON SYSTEM 54 UNDER MY DIRECTORY (WASOWSKI)ENG.RPT,  
THIS REPORT IS A SORT BY MACHINE SERIAL # OF ALL THE MISSING NODES.   
ON THIS REPORT THERE IS A SITE NUMBER COLUM, THIS IS THE SAME SITE    
USED ON THE OES SALES ORDERS FOR NEW INSTALLS. ALSO YOU WILL NOTICE   
A DATE SHIPPED COLUM, THIS SHOWS THE DATE THE EQUIPMENT WAS SHIPPED   
FROM MANUFACTURING. THERE ARE SOME REMARKABLE MACHINES LISTED THERE   
223 OF THEM WERE SHIPPED IN 1985 AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM, THEN THERE   
192 THAT WERE SHIPPED IN 1984 THAT WE CAN'T FIND. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO  
BELIEVE THAT MACHINES THAT WERE SHIPPED FROM 1 TO 22 MONTHS CAN'T
BE ACCOUNTED FOR.   
     
ANY AND ALL MACHINES ARE TO LOOKED AT TO FIND THESE SERIAL #'S. ALL   
NETWORK MACHINES, LAB MACHINES (YES, EVEN THOSE ONES THAT YOU HAVE    
MADE YOUR SELF OR ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO HAVE), PENDING INSTALLS, DE-
INSTALLS, AND ALL SPARE MICROS. ALL MICROS ARE TO BE COUNTED GOOD,    
BAD, SPARES, WHATEVER....
     
THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING THESE MACHINES CANNOT BE RELAYED IN THE SPACE    
AVAILABLE. THIS EQUIPMENT IS WORTH SEVERAL MILLONS OF DOLLARS AND
MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR !!!!!!  
     
CURT MILLER IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS SITUATION AND IS  IN TOTAL AGREEMENT    
WITH FINANCE AND NYSELF THAT THIS EQUIPMENT MUST BE FOUND AND THEIR   
SERIALS RECORDED. CURT HAS ASSURED FINANCE THE THE FIELD WILL GIVE IT'S    
FULL COOPERATION IN THIS PROJECT.

  SUBJECT:   PUBLIC NETWORK CODE SYSTEMS
 
  ===============================================================
 
  We  are  now  targeting implementation of the  four-host  public 
  network  code system for the weekend of  December  13-15.   This 
  would  mean that effective Monday,  December 16,  the  following 
  systems will be used as outlined:
 
             D25        TO BE USED BY HQ AND FIELD AS THE
                        PRIMARY SYSTEM FOR GENERATION OF
                        ALL CODE FOR NODES WITH NUMBERS
                        BELOW 4000.  ALSO TO BE USED BY
                        NETCON AND FIELD AS THE PRIMARY
                        SYSTEM FOR LOADING CODE FOR NODES
                        BELOW # 4000.
 
             C70        TO BE USED BY THE ABOVE FOR THE 
                        ABOVE REASONS WHEN D25 IS UNAVAILABLE.
 
                        TO BE USED BY TYMNET OPERATIONS
                        AS A BACKUP SYSTEM FOR NETSTATS.
 
             D54        TO BE USED BY HQ AND FIELD AS THE
                        PRIMARY SYSTEM FOR GENERATION OF
                        ALL CODE FOR NODES WITH NUMBERS 4000
                        AND ABOVE.  ALSO TO BE USED BY NETCON
                        AND FIELD AS THE PRIMARY SYSTEM FOR
                        LOADING CODE FOR NODES 4000 AND ABOVE.
 
             C33        TO BE USED BY THE ABOVE FOR THE
                        ABOVE REASONS WHEN D54 IS UNAVAILABLE.
 
                        TO BE USED BY PMTS AS THEIR PRIMARY
                        SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
                                                                Page  2

 
 
  Validations  has validated those usernames submitted to me  over 
  the  past  two months on D54 and other systems  as  appropriate.  
  Please verify that you are valid where you need to be.
 
 
  
  It will be your responsibility to transfer your own files to the 
  appropriate  system and delete files no longer necessary  (i.e., 
  no longer need to keep files relating to nodes below 4000 on C33 
  after December 15).
 
  We  will work with operations to copy the TYM4000 directory from 
  25 to 54 and 33 (then deleting it from 25 & 70); and copying the 
  TYMNET directory from 25 to 70.
 
  Beryl Agua will shortly publish the new backup procedures  which 
  reflect the above configuration.   These procedures require that 
  each  Region (or Area) have a central directory available on all 
  four  systems  which will be used to store  all  field-generated 
  code for backup purposes.   These directories will also serve to 
  eliminate  confusion  in  locating  code  for  'on-call'   field 
  personnel.    Please notify her by Friday, December 6 as to what 
  those central directories are.
 
  We  will be closely monitoring the use of these four systems and 
  request your cooperation in minimizing the use of aux ciruits to 
  go from system to system.  This, while convenient, unnecessarily 
  ties up job slots/ports on multiple machines, blocking access to 
  others who may need it, and slowing down responsiveness.
 
  We  sincerely  hope  this new arrangement  will  improve  system 
  availability and response time.

Subject: Change to the Node Naming Convention

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Node naming convention is being changed to include a number for the ap-
propriate region. The break down is as follows:

                WNFE = 1
                CNFE = 2
                ENFE = 3

The district is also being changed in some cases to fit more closely with the 
city. The breakdown is as follows:

** WNFE **

Old District       New District          
   Letter             Letter             District (City)

     A                  C                China Basin
     S                  S                Santa Clara - South Bay
     S                  E                Santa Clara - East Bay
     L                  L                Los Angeles
     T                  T                Seattle
     V                  D                Denver
     X                  P                Phoenix

     M                  S                St. Louis
     D                  D                Dallas
     H                  H                Houston
                        U                Austin
     H                  A                Atlantic





Old District       New District
   Letter             Letter             District (City)


** ENFE **

     B                  B                Boston
     N                  N                New York
     P                  P                Philidelphia
     W                  W                Washington










The break down will be as follows, the first six (6) characters will still be 
for the Company name or city if Tymnet, the underscore will change to the number 
that corresponds with the appropriate region, the second to the last character 
will be the district letter from above, and the last letter will correspond with 
the software type of the engine. The breakdown of software type is as follows:

          A = Async Tymsat or Consat
          B = Base
          I = Isis (regardless of engine i.e mini-engine, micro-                 
              engine, etc.)
          S = Switcher
          U = ATC


The node name should look like the following:

         DALLAS2DI   this would be a Tymnet node in Dallas (DALLAS),
                     which is CNFE (2), the district is Dallas (D),                                            
                     and the engine is running ISIS software (I).

To:       MDC Plant Lists A-D; ISG Plant List A-C

Subject:  Organization Changes in MDC Aerospace Group


1.  Effective  1  January  1986,  there  will  be several changes
    within  the  MDC Aerospace Group.  These changes are a result
    of  the continuous evaluation of organizational relationships
    to  ensure  that  operational effectiveness, productivity and
    service  delivery are maximized.  During the past two months,
    attention  has been focused on the reporting relationships of
    MDAIS, MDMC and MDRL within the Aerospace Group.

2.  Ernie  H.  Ridenhour is appointed Vice President, Information
    Resource  Management  (IRM)  and will report to R. L. Johnson
    and  R.  C.  Little;  MDAIS  will  report  to  Ernie.    This
    reorganization   recognizes   the   important  economies  and
    efficiencies  of  combining  information  resource  planning,
    management  and  service delivery into a single organization.
    As  a  result,  IRM and MDAIS' total support of all Component
    "customers" should be strengthened.

3.  Since  January  1984,  MDMC has been building a customer base
    outside  MDC  as well as developing its capabilities as a MDC
    technology  resource  center.    To  facilitate achieving its
    internal  and  external business objectives, MDMC will report
    directly to R. C. Little.

4.  MDRL  will  report  to  Kenneth  A.  Francis, Vice President,
    Aerospace  Engineering  and  Operations.   MDRL will continue
    its  role  as  a  basic  research  resource for the Aerospace
    Group Engineering organizations.

5.  In   recognition   of  their  responsibilities  as  heads  of
    significant  resource  units, the following title changes are
    effective 1 January 1986:

          W. B. (Brad) Rigdon       General Manager, MDAIS
          Anatole Browde            General Manager, MDMC
          Donald P. Ames            General Manager, MDRL

6.  We  believe these organizational changes will further improve
    the capabilities of the MDC Aerospace Group.

AS OF THURSDAY, JANUARY 2, 1986, THE MICOMS INVENTORY SYSTEM WAS
REPLACED BY THE CIMS INVENTORY SYSTEM.

ALL SITES HAVE BEEN SENT NEW CIMS FIELD OFFICE PROCEDURE MANUALS. 
PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THESE MANUALS AND REFER TO THEM IF
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING NEW PROCEDURES.  IF YOUR SITE HAS NOT
RECEIVED A MANUAL, PLEASE CONTACT KATHE FRONCKOWIAK AT:

CHANGES IN PROCEDURE ARE RELATIVELY FEW, HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
ALL PERSONNEL FOLLOW A FEW GUIDELINES TO INSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION.

1.  NEW "TRANSFER/RETURNED GOODS SHIPPERS" FORMS ARE BEING SENT TO ALL
    FIELD SITES.  WHEN RETURNING PARTS FOR REPAIR, OR TRANSFERRING PARTS
    BETWEEN SITES, THIS FORM WILL BE USED.  ANY TIME PARTS ARE TRANSFERRED
    BETWEEN SITES, THE FIELD TRANSFER FORM MUST - REPEAT, MUST - BE
    RETURNED TO MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR DATA ENTRY.  MANDATORY FIELDS
    REQUIRING INFORMATION ARE:

    A.  SHIPPER NUMBER (FROM LOG BOOK)
    B.  DATE
                                                                Page  2

    C.  FROM LOCATION
    D.  TO LOCATION
    E.  CORRECT PART NUMBER

    IF THIS INFORMATION IS OMITTED, IT WILL BE RETURNED TO YOUR SITE FOR
    COMPLETION.  PLEASE BEGIN USING THESE FORMS AS SOON AS THEY ARE
    RECEIVED.  THIS FORM WILL REPLACE THE SHIPPING AUTHORIZATION FORM.

2.  ALL PART INQUIRIES WILL BE DONE BY LOGGING INTO THE "DISPATCH INVENTORY

RE:  DATATROL PROCEDURES 
     
     
EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1986 THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES FOR DATATROL (T-20)
TERMINALS WILL BE IN EFFECT.  
     
1.      ALL DEFECTIVE DATATROLS ARE TO BE SHIPPED TO:    
     
                        MDFSC  
                        40547 ALBRAE STREET

2.      INVENTORY CONTROL
     
        ALL DATATORL INVENTORY TRACKING WILL BE DONE ON THE MENTRY 
        PARTS SYSTEM.  PLEASE TRANSFER ALL DEFECTIVE **DATATROLS** 
        TO SITE NUMBER 1202 (FREMONT DEFECTIVE ACCOUNT). 
     
        THE MENTRY PARTS SYSTEM WILL CONVERT TO CIMS IN MARCH OF '86'   
        AT THAT TIME PROCEDURE CHANGES WILL BE MADE.
     
3.      DATATROL ORDERING
     
        ROUTINE ORDERING OF DATATROLS WILL REMAIN THE SAME, VIA THE
        PARTS ORDERING SYSTEM.  
     
        P-1 ORDERS CAN BE ACCESSED EITHER THROUGH KING OF PRUSSIA OR    
        FREMONT.  THE MAIN CONTACT FOR ANY DATATROL QUESTIONS OR   
        PROBLEMS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO SCOTT AYARS @ 415/659-8600 
        OR FSC.S/AYARS.    
     
4.      ADDRESS CARDS AND POWER TRANSFORMERS.
     
        WHEN RETURNING DEFECTIVE DATATROLS FOR REPAIR "DO NOT" SEND
        IN THE ADDRESS CARDS OR POWER TRANSFORMERS UNLESS THEY ARE 
        KNOWN BAD.  REPLACEMENT DATATROLS ARE SENT WITHOUT THESE   
        ITEMS UNLESS ASKED FOR. 
     
        THE ADDRESS CARDS CAN VERY EASILY BE RESOLDERED TO CUT NEW 
        ADDRESSES AND SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED FOR THAT REASON.  SINCE    
        THERE ARE NO COMPONENTS ON THE PC IT'S HARD TO HAVE A 
        DEFECTIVE ADDRESS CARD.

============================================================
 
An Ontyme interface is now available on the M7000.
If you are located at 2351 MCGAW, instructions for it's use
will follow. If you are located elsewhere and have access to
an M7000, I will be glad to send the software if you send
the request to me, along with a blank tape.
 
This interface allows printing of Ontyme messages and Ontyme
workspace.  Printing can take place on any of the Production
System printers, of which there are three.  "LPTR", "LAB",
and "GE".
 
Messages and workspace may also be captured in a disk file.
 
Disk files may be transfered to Ontyme workspace.  This
allows the user to use the M7000's superior editor or the
TEXTPRO wordprocessor to create and edit messages before
transferring to Ontyme.
 
This interface is menu driven and rather easy to use.

Subject: New F3 status 

The line from node 3143 has been cut & strung... Dennis Ernst is going
to build us code as node 2770 (same as 2770 connected to 6657!) with
host number 118.  When TYMNET gets around to giving us a new node and
host and line from one of the engines, we will consider reconfiguring
everything.  (Dennis Coffey estimates 3 weeks on that, I'd say a month).

The 2770 code should have been finished friday afternoon.  Just before
I left for the evening, I plugged in the cable to the DxP-11 card in
the NETCON box and realized we needed a cross-over of some sort...  On
Monday (today) we can find the right cross-over, build a monitor, try
to load 2770 and if everything works, build a 2 or 3 pack system.

We have received many phone calls inquiring about missing optional 
life insurance deductions.  Due to insufficient data received from 
PPS II, this deduction was omitted from your paycheck.

If you enrolled in the optional life insurance, you will notice on 
your paycheck for week ending January 19, 1986 a total deduction
for four (4) weeks.  Thereafter, your deduction will be calculated
on a weekly basis.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  If you
have any questions concerning this situation, please contact
Johann Stone at (714) 250-1000 x2183.

Subject: Node 2770 up! 

I finally got node 2770 up and running.  I swapped hardware around with
Dennis' blessing and he re-cut code for it with the swapped hardware. I
put the DUV-11 board from node 555 in place of the MDB DUV-11 look-alike
and replaced the M9400 (REV11-A) bootstrap with the M8012 BDV11 board
from the 2-cabinet micronode.  I found another DUV cable and used that
while trying to find out why it wasn't loading.

Turns out it's supposed to be plugged into slot 3 (0,1,2,3 : 4th) from the
left (and not from the right) on node 3143.

We need to do the following:

    1)  Make a new monitor for system X118 with ^D33 ports.
    2)  Make a TITO save tape.
    3)  Make sure the disks are formatted (I think they are).
    4)  Define a 2 or 3 pack structure.  I vote for 3.
    5)  Refresh & rebuild it from 930's all-files tape, selected directories.

Joe,
  Any reason P15 shouldn't work?  If not, it's ready to go.
If so, then we should simply build a /P from sources in (OSP).
Either a monitor tape, or just copy it across with TITO, then
we can bring the other system up on the network.

When loading, there were lots and lots of "lost" packets according
to the LOADII program.  I donno if that means we have a flakey line
or not.  We'll find out later.

Please see my comments on (M33)FEFILE.NWS and PSETID.NWS about the

needed to standardize BOOTS and FEFILE, as well as provide a beginning
solution to the problems we are going to see with non-removable packs
and larger disk systems.

COMMOD.MAC has already been changed to reflect these new entries.
     I re-used some of the SWAP pointers, HOMK4S > HOMSPS, HOMSWP > HOMFEF
     and UNISWP > UNIFEP.

REFSTR, UUOCON and KSFEFS still need to be modified.
KSBLOD has already been modified to use BOOT pages 3,4,5 as all other
processors already do.

Subject: System 118 

System 118 is being rebuilt from 930's last all-files tapes made by OSMAN
this past week-end.  Whomever come in earliest, please put up the next
tape(s) and continue the restore.

The plan is to make a duplicate 930 file structure, then to delete all
the monitor sources from 118 and delete all the applications sources that
are on 930 (leaving them on 118).  There of course, will be some small
duplication, but that chan be pared down as time goes by.

System 118 is up!!!
I've deleted major portions of (M33),(OSU),(KSBACK) and a few more,
completely deleted (OSP),(OSB) and a few more, removed CTMKTG1 and
CTMKTG7 from the system, and trimmed as much as I could find out of
"Monitor-only" directories.

The result: 50,000 +++ free pages on system 118!

Subject: BIO-ZAP patch 

I've made patch #9, BIOZAP.PAT and installed it on systems C26 & D25
both in SYSTEM.SAV and the running monitor.  The patch addresses two
areas:
  1) STOPCD if T3/ LDBBIO(U) = 0 and a zapper was not seen
                                 if seen, then act if no room for data
     simulates STOPCD(DEBUG,BIOZAP)

  2) GETBIO routine ought to check if the port it's allocating a buffer
     on is really there (not zapped).

If C26 & D25 seem to run "clean" then I will propagate the patch to all
the other systems and fit the fix into the sources.

Subject: ADDPAK vs REFRESH 

Joe,
  The code in ADD UNIT tests a lot of things and all go to CANTAD which
prints out the message CAN NOT ADD UNIT TO STRUCTURE.  However, I suspect
that it took the error return from PAKREF.  This is because there is an
AOBJN pointer that says to read the RIB for each of the per-pack files
which were (2) SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS and now are (3) SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS and
SPAGES.SYS.  In PAKREF, at PREF2 + it says to error return if the rib is
blank... and in the OLD structures SWAP.SYS has been obliterated.  You
need to REFRESH first to setup the rib for SPAGES.SYS and then an ADDPAK
should work fine.

           UNSOLICITED RESPONSES
           FROZEN CURSORS

IF YOU ARE SERVICING A SYSTEM THAT HAS REPORTED THESE PROBLEMS OR
ONES THAT ARE SIMILAR , BE SURE TO ASK THEM WHEN THE TROUBLES STARTED
AND WHEN THEY MADE THE SWITCH TO THE 5.9 SOFTWARE. IF AGENCY STILL HAS
IT'S OLD OPERATING SOFTWARE YOU CAN USE IT TO REINIT SYSTEM AND CHECK
WHETHER CRT TROUBLES ARE STILL OCCURING. IF THEY STOP , THEN YOU HAVE
TWO OPTIONS. YOU CAN ADVISE AGENCY THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE
USING THE OLD OPERATING SOFTWARE. OR YOU CAN RESET THE BAUD RATE FOR
THE LAST CRT <LAST ADDRESS IN SYSTEM> FOR 4800 BAUD INSTEAD OF NORMAL
OPERATING BAUD RATE OF 9600 BAUD. THEN YOU CAN BRING SYSTEM BACK UP
ON NEW 5.9 SOFTWARE AND CRT PROBLEMS SHOULD DISAPPEAR. BUT IT IS
                                                                Page  2

VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FIRST EXPLAIN THESE OPTIONS WITH THE AGENCY
AND ALLOW THEM TO MAKE DECISION. IF AGENCY DECIDES TO HAVE ONE CRT
RESET TO 4800 BAUD , MAKE CHANGE TO CRT THAT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT
OF TRAFFIC.

THIS IS ONLY A QUICK-FIX SOLUTION TILL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CORRECTS
PROBLEMS WITH SYSTEM <DATA CENTER'S 6/53'S> OPERATING SOFTWARE.

DATA LEAVES AGENCY'S 6/23 AND GOES TO DATA CENTER'S 6/53 COMPUTER
VIA TYMNET. DATA IS THEN TRANSLATED BY 6/53 TO THE AIRLINES'
COMPUTER'S LANGUAGE AND SENT TO AIRLINES FOR ANSWER. ANSWER <DATA>
IS THEN RETURNED TO DATA CENTER'S 6/53 TO BE TRANSLATED BACK TO
OUR OPERATING LANGUAGE. AFTER TRANSLATION DATA IS SENT TO THE
AGENCY'S 6/23 AND APPEARS ON ONE OF IT'S CRT'S DISPLAY.

THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN DATA CENTER'S 6/53 IS TRANSLATING DATA < ANSWER>
FROM AIRLINES COMPUTER TO OUR OPERATING LANGUAGE. IN SOME CASES
WE LOSE THE "END OF MEESAGE TAG". THIS WILL CREATE A MULTITUDE
OF PROBELMS FOR THE 6/23 WHICH IS SLAVED TO THE 6/53.



************************************************************************


ADDED NOTE:

IF YOU HAVE AGENCY'S THAT ARE REPORTING THAT THEIR CRTS ARE 
GENERATING TICKET COMMANDS ON THEIR OWN , BE SURE TO ASK THEM
WHETHER THEY WERE BUILDING A RECORD WHEN TICKET COMMAND WAS
GENERATED. THIS IS BECAUSE WHILE THEY ARE BUILDING A RECORD THEY
USE THE "0/SEGMENT" KEY. IF THEY ACCIDENTLY HIT THE "0/SEGMENT"
KEY AND THE "F7" KEY TOGETHER < THE "F7 KEY IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE
"0/SEGMENT" KEY" > THE SYSTEM WILL SEE THIS AS A TICKET COMMAND.
WE CALL THIS THE "FAT FINGER SYNDROME". TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN YOU CAN ASK THE AGENT TO BE MORE CAREFUL OR REMOVE THE 
"F7" KEY'S TOP. YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE KEY AND BREAK OFF IT'S
PINS AND THEN PLACE IT BACK INTO KEYBOARD. THIS WAY YOU CAN LEAVE
THE KEY'S TOP ON.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO EVERYONES ATTENTION TWO ITEMS OF INTEREST
IN WORKING ON THE HONEYWELL 6/23 SYSTEM. THEY ARE:


1. NOW THAT WE HAVE NEW OPERATING SOFTWARE THERE IS A TROUBLE SYMPTOM
   CHANGE. WITH THE OLD SOFTWARE WHEN THE TRANSMIT KEY EXPERIENCED
   ELECTRICAL BOUNCES YOU WOULD SEE THE CURSOR DROP SEVERAL LINES
   INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL ONE LINE DROP. WITH THE NEW 5.0 - 5.9
   SOFTWARE THE CURSOR WILL ONLY DROP ONE LINE. INSTEAD THE SYSTEM WILL SEE
   EACH TRANSMIT AS A SEPERATE COMMAND. YOU WILL SEE YOUR REPLY
   TO YOUR REQUEST PLUS YOU WILL SEE SEVERAL ERROR MESSAGES SUCH AS
   "INVALID FORMAT" APPEARING ON FOLLOWING LINES. YOU MAY JUST HAVE
   A COLD SOLDER JOINT BUT IT IS ADVISABLE TO REPLACE THE KEY. WHEN-
   EVER YOU OPEN THE KEYBOARD IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE YOUR SOLDERING
   IRON AND GO OVER ALL OF THE KEYS SOLDER JOINTS. IF YOU FIND A COLD 
   SOLDER JOINT IT WILL COLLAPSE WHEN SOLDERING IRON IS PLACED
   ON IT. THIS EXTRA STEP MAY SAVE YOU TROUBLE IN THE FUTURE AND TAKES
   ONLY A FEW EXTRA MINUTES.

2. WHEN PERFORMING PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ON THE HONEYWELL 6/23 IT IS
                                                                Page  2

   VERY IMPORTANT TO CLEAN THE CONTROLLER BOARD'S CONTACTS. THIS CAN BE
   DONE WITH A PENCIL ERACER. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CLEAN THE POWER
   SUPPLIES AND TAKE APART THE DISK DRIVE POWER SUPPLY TO CLEAN IT.
   THERE ARE TWO VENTS IN THE BACK OF THE CARD CAGE WHERE AIR IS DRAWN
   THROUGH BY THE BUS POWER SUPPLY FANS TO COOL THE CONTROLLER
   BOARDS. THESE VENTS NEED TO BE CLEANED ALSO.

ADDED NOTE: WHEN YOU HAVE A HONEYWELL <PRU1001> PRINTER THAT IS SHUTTING
            ITSELF <KICKING IT'S OWN CIRCUIT BREAKER> OFF YOU SHOULD
            FIRST CHECK THE BRIDGE DIODE CR01. THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE
            THE CAUSE OF PROBLEM IN ABOUT 98% OF OUR PRINTER PROBLEMS
            DESCRIBED ABOVE.

Subject: DISPATCH PARTS STATUS PROCEDURE (TOSS) Jerry: 

        Below is the procedure for using the Dispatch Part Status
        function (TOSS).  I have not received any word on what the
        username and password will be, so we will use what is in the
        procedure below.

                             DISPATCH PART STATUS

        This procedure is used to find the location of a part using
        the Dispatch Part Status function.  This procedure assumes
        that you are using one of the supported terminals listed
        below.  If you are using a different terminal, variations in
        these procedures may be necessary.  All data entered must be
        in upper-case.

        1.   The terminal displays "please type your terminal
             identifier" or a string of nonsense.  Enter an "A."

        2.   The terminal displays the message "please log in:."

             -    Press the CTRL key and the R key at the same time
             -    Press the CTRL key and the D key at the same time
             -    Press the CTRL key and the C key at the same time
             -    Enter "CUS.SERV.MGR;7577"
             -    Press the carriage return key

        3.   You are asked to enter the name of the system you want to
             access.  Enter "FSV-1" and press the carriage return key.

        4.   The system displays LOGON TO FSV-1.  Enter "006989" and
             press the carriage return key.

        5.   The system displays PASSWORD.  Enter "SPARES" and press
             the carriage return key.

        6.   The system responds with THIS IS MDFSC CENTRAL DISPATCH.

        7.   The system displays:

             ENTER T FOR TOSS OR E FOR END:

             Enter "T" and press the carriage return key.

        8.   The system displays:

                  ENTER TERMINAL TYPE:

                  "A" = ADM31 (TYM425)
                  "H" = HP2621 (TYM444)
                  "M" = MICRODATA PRISM
                  "P" = PERKIN-ELMER 1251 (TYM470)
                  "S" = SCANSET
                  "V" = VT100-VT102

             Select the terminal type, enter it, and press the
             carriage return key.

        9.   The terminal displays:

                  ENTER REGION TO SEARCH:
                  91 = WESTERN REGION
                  92 = CENTRAL REGION
                  93 = EASTERN REGION
                  ALL = ALL REGIONS

             Enter the region and press the carriage return key.

        10.  You are asked to enter the part number.  Enter it and
             press the carriage return key.

        11.  The terminal displays any locations having the part.

             If you are not sure of where to send a part, you can use
             this screen to check the disposition code which appears
             in the upper right-hand corner.  The first position
             following the word "DISPOSITION:" is the disposition
             code:

                  I = Irvine depot (CSC)
                  A = Atlanta depot (CSC)
                  F = Fremont depot (Third-party)
                  P = King-of-Prussia depot (Tymnet)

             At the bottom of the display, the following message
             appears:

             Press (S)ubstitutes; (N)ew Part; (/) to exit Dispatch

             If you enter "S", you can display the locations of the
             substitute parts for the part number you entered.  If you
             enter "N", you can look for the locations of another
             part.

        12.  Find the location that has the part and call them and
             tell them that you need to have the part shipped to you.

        13.  If no location within your region has the part, you must
             call the appropriate depot and they will locate the part
             for you.

        14.  To exit, enter a "/" at the message:

             Press (S)ubstitutes; (N)ew Part; (/) to exit Dispatch

             The system then displays the message:

             ENTER T FOR TOSS OR E FOR END:

             Enter "E" and press the carriage return key.  Turn off
             the terminal.

1. VIP7200 CRT'S RASTER IS TOO BRITE BUT THE DISPLAY IS ADJUSTABLE;


       CHECK THE 7800 UFD CAP ON THE VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOAD.


2. VIP7200 IS MISSING IT'S VIDEO <DISPLAY> , OR IT'S HORIZONTAL SYNC;


      CHECK THE LOCATION B14 <SN74LSI161AN> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


3. VIP7200'S CURSOR WON'T MOVE WILL WILL TYPE CHARACTORS;


      CHECK THE LOCATION M06 OR M07 <SN74LS08N> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


4. VIP7200'S RASTER OKAY BUT DISPLAY <BRITENESS> CAN'T BE ADJSTED;
                                                                Page  2



      CHECK THE CAP C431 ON VIP7200'S VIDEO BOARD.


5. VIP7200 HAS A VERY ERACTIC DISPLAY , SCREEN JUMPS AROUND;


      THERE IS RIPPLE ON VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOARD-REPLACE.


6. VIP7200'S TOP LINE OF DISPLAY IS CURVED OR BENT;


      CHECK R29 ON VIP7200'S VIDEO BOARD FOR OPEN OR LOSS OF RESISTANCE.


7. VIP7200 DISPLAYS ONLY EVERY OTHER LINE;


      CHECK LOCATION E05 <SN74LS193> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


8. VIP7200 DISPLAYS RANDOM CHARACTORS;


      CHECK FOR 15V ON 5V PIN ON VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOARD. IF
      IT IS PRESENT THEN Q03 IS OPEN BETWEEN B-C. REPLACE.
      ALSO CHECK VIP7200'S KCM BOARD CONTACTS AND CLEAN THEM. THE
      DIRTY CONTACTS CAN CAUSE ABOVE PROBLEM AND ALSO FROZEN CURSORS.



ADDED NOTE: YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CLEAN THE CONTACTS ON THE KCM BOARDS
            EVEN IF YOU ARE WORKING ON A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
            IF YOU CHECK +5 VOLTS ON THE DISK DRIVE POWER SUPPLY
            AND IT SHOWS +2.5 OR LESS VOLTAGE THEN CHECK THE
            REGULATOR LM323K.

          CHANGE IN TAX LAWS - TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS





    McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (ISG) employees 
attending a college, university or other reimbursable program 
under the ISG Tuition Reimbursement benefit should be aware of a 
change in the tax law concerning tuition reimbursements.

    Code Section 127 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 
1978 and excluded tuition reimbursements from gross income.  This 
section of the Code expired on December 31, 1985 and unless a new 
Code amendment is passed or the present one extended, tuition 
reimbursements will be included in gross income and subject to tax 
withholdings beginning January 1, 1986.  As a result, tuition 
reimbursements paid to employees after January 1, 1986 will 
reflect the withholding of the appropriate amount as required by 
the law.

    There is an indication that Congress may act in early 1986 to 
reinstate the provisions of section 127.  If that occurs, ISG will 
make appropriate refunds to the affected employees.

    account  number  as  the  card the employee is currently using.
    Therefore,  when  the new card is received, the card containing
    the company's name should be destroyed.

3.  The  new  Corporate American Express Card is still considered a
    corporate  card  and  all  rules and regulations governing such
    card is still in effect.

4.  The  reissuing  of all cards should be completed by 1 April 86.
    If  you  have  not  received your new card by that date, please
    contact Glenda Goodman in St. Louis at (314) 234-6898.

Subject: BAD SYSUFD PATCH 

Correction:  The patch to turn off the weird SYS:.UFD = (UFD).UFD does
what we expected... however, we didn't expect that some old accounting
programs actually used that "feature"/"bug" and thus, we cannot patch
it at the moment.

   I went around to most of the Dallas machines with the new /P-8 monitors
and in an effort to just "get it done before I forgot again" I put the
instructiuon  "CAME T1,MFDPPN" back where it was patched out of both the
running /P-8 monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on
  27, 31, 37, 56 and 65.   Just fixed (SYS)NEWMON on 25, 72 and 79.

DID NOT FIX systems 23 and 54 since they were unavailable for some reason
at this time.  Someone (OSMAN,JOE) please check them and un-do the SYSUFD
patch:

  FILUUO$:   CHKPP1+2/ JFCL 0   <== replace with CAME T1,MFDPPN

I did NOT update P-8 to P-8 because I was in a hurry and don't feel all
that well at the moment... I was just trying to do it while it was on my
mind.

Subject:  RESTRUCTURING OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
          COMPANY AND DISSOLUTION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
          DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS COMPANY


We need to do everything we can to ensure the ISG meets its 1986 
revenue and earnings objectives.  In line with this need I am 
announcing, effective today, the following organizational changes:

o   The North American Marketing and Sales organization that 
    formerly reported within McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
    Systems Company is now part of McDonnell Douglas Computer 
    Systems Company.  This restructuring will better equip the 
    Computer Systems Company to compete in the business systems 
    marketplace while it continues to meet ISG's internal hardware 
    manufacturing needs.  The restructured company will be headed 
    up by Otis Brinkley as President, with Vern Smith as Executive 
    Vice President.  In the coming weeks, Otis and Vern will work 
    together to develop an optimal structure for the Computer 
    Systems Company.

o   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company has been 
    dissolved in an effort to narrow the range of our business 
    activities and focus more on profitability.  The business 
    units within the Distribution Systems Company have been 
    reassigned as follows:

    -     Our Commercial Distribution Systems and Electronic Data 
          Interchange businesses are now part of McDonnell Douglas 
          Diversified Information Systems Company.  As such, these 
          businesses will continue to pursue their 1986 Operating 
          Plan objectives.

    -     Our embryonic Retail Systems business is being assigned 
          to ISG Marketing and Planning, where it will continue to 
          develop its strategy, though at a much lower level of 
          investment than we had planned for the balance of 1986.





1'm confident that these actions will increase our chances of 
achieving our 1986 objectives.  I'm counting on you not only to 
support these moves, but to do whatever you can to ease the 
transition for the people affected by them.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  elected medical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

         DEFERRAL OF ISG MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT

CC:      Business Unit Coordinators



One  of  the  principles  given  to us this year is to manage ISG's
operating  results month by month.  In so doing, we have determined
a  need  to  minimize  ISG costs in the first half of the year.  To
respond  to that need we have moved the Management and Professional
Development  Phases  I-VII  provided  to  MDAIS  into the first two
quarters of 1986.

To  accomplish  this adjustment, MDAIS Phases have been substituted
for  ISG  Phases.    Subsequently, those ISG Phases scheduled after
March 17 will be deferred into the last half of the year.
 
In  addition  to  having  a  significant  favorable impact on ISG's
operating  results  for the first half of this year, the completion
dates  for  Phases  III  and V are moved forward.  As a result, the
full  line of Phases will be in production for the ISG beginning in
June.

The  revised  schedule  and allocations will be available from your
business  unit  coordinator  on  April 8.  It is important that you
continue   to   plan   for   your,   and/or   your   subordinates',
participation  in  the  proper  Phase.  Advance planning allows for
timely  notification  of  participants and for time to complete the
required prework for Phase attendance.

The Computer Systems Company has decided to curtail operations of 
the Distributed Systems Company.   This decision has been made as 
a result of declining prices for DSC products in the marketplace.  
Distributed  Systems  has  been operating at a loss  for  several 
months, with no relief in sight. 
 
Effective  immediately,  DSC  will no longer  accept  orders  for 
products.   For further information until April 11, 1986, contact

         INTERCOMPANY PRICING BOARD CHANGES



    Effective  immediately,  the  charter  and  composition  of the
    Intercompany Pricing Board are changed as follows.

    The charter of the Intercompany Pricing Board is to:

    o    Establish  operational  ground  rules  and  procedures  as
         necessary to ensure effective implementation of policy.

    o    Review   and  approve  proposed  changes  to  intercompany
         Pricings.

    o    Review  operation of intercompany pricing policy, Pricings
         and  supporting  systems  and  make recommendations to ISG
         Executive  Management  as  necessary  to  ensure effective
         operation of intercompany pricing policy.

    o    Resolve    issues   relating   to   intercompany   pricing
         including,  when  appropriate,  making  recommendations to
         and obtaining approval of Executive Management.

    o    Interpret  intercompany  pricing policy as required in the
         operational environment.

    o    Determine specific handling of exceptional situations.

    o    Ensure  that decisions reached by the Intercompany Pricing
         Board  are implemented in the organizations represented by
         members of the Board.

    With  the  undersigned  as  Chairman,  the Intercompany Pricing
    Board will include the following representatives:

         Craig, S. L.:                  Payment Systems Co.
        *Donovan, J. R.:                ISG  Marketing and Planning
                                        (ex officio)
         Elbert, J. B.:                 Network Systems Co.
         Freeman, F. R.:                Information      Processing
                                        Center
         Frey, D. J.:                   Manufacturing             &
                                        Engineering Systems Co.
         Horn, E. T.:                   Government Services
         Johnson, R. W.:                Computer Systems Co.
         Kintsch, H. J.:                Field Service Co.
         Kos, J. J.:                    Health Systems Co.
        *Krone, L. H.:                  ISG     Marketing    Policy
                                        (Alternate Chairman)






             *LeCroy, E. P.:     ISG Finance
             *Mundloch, R. A.:   ISG Finance
              Schenk, R. W.:     Diversified Information Systems Co.
              Schneider, D. A:   Communications Industry Systems Co.
              Vickroy, W. R.:    Information Systems International
             *Wiedenmann, P. W.: ISG Finance (ex officio)

    Those  Pricing  Board  members  indicated  by * are also members of the
    Intercompany   Pricing  Board  Executive  Council.    This  Council  is
    established  to  provide  timely  and  efficient  resolution of pricing
    questions  at  such  times  when  business conditions do not permit the
    assembly  of  the  full  Intercompany  Pricing Board.  The Council will
    meet only as occasionally required.

    Don  W.  Gerth has successfully completed his assignment to develop the
    policy  and  supervise the implementation of ISG's intercompany pricing
    mechanism.      Without   his  energy  and  attention  to  detail,  the
    intercompany  pricing  program would not be as complete as it is today.
    Effective  14  February  1986,  Don leaves ISG Marketing and returns to
    the  McDonnell  Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems Company.  Please
    join  me  in  expressing appreciation to Don for his outstanding effort
    over the past year.

    With   D.  W.  Gerth's  departure,  responsibility  for  the  continued
    operation  of  Intercompany  Pricing  is  transferred  to ISG Marketing
    Policy,  the  focal point for Intercompany Pricing administration.  All
    future  intercompany pricing matters should be addressed to L. H. Krone
    (I014/301/4E; Phone:  314-233-0002, ONTYME:  ISGHQ.L/KRONE).
    Your continued cooperation will be appreciated.

Subject: LOGON and SWITCH.INI 

It is "nice" that LOGON will let you select options based on node-port
or simply node.  TYMNET nodes on the otherhand do NOT, (I repeat, do NOT)_,
report the physical port number anymore.  Not just the micro-nodes... all
TYMNET nodes are that way...  so, physical port number is meaningless in
99.9 percent of the cases.  (On a micronode,connected to a host, it has a
little meaning, by co-incidence).  The port reported is more likely the
circuit number reported to ISIS (or it's look-alikes).

So,  please don't feel that you are having problems with LOGON if you
cannot get it to select on a specific port.  TYMNET isn't really reporting
the physical port to the host anymore.  The Node information IS correct if
you are coming from a real node, and sometimes is a lie for internal circuits
on a micro-node host.  All "real" circuits, are supposed to be correct.

Sigh!

RE: Tymnet Basic Product School    
     
In an effort to acquaint all ISG Business Units with TYMNET,
McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company we have opened up 
enrollment for the Tymnet Training & Education Basic Product
School to all ISG employees.  The school will be held at the
TTE facility in San Jose, California on May 5-8, 1986. 
     
Not only will the school better acquaint you with TYMNET in 
general, but it also will provide you with knowledge of what
services and products TYMNET provides as a Value Added Network.  
As a leader in the data communications field and as an integral  
part of ISG, we know that many of you would like to know some-   
thing about us.
     
We encourage those wishing at attend to enroll as soon as possible    
as space is limited.  Enrollments can be made through OnTyme:    
     
                :EXEC *** TTE.BPSENROLL 
     
or by calling the TTE Registrar, Cheryl McGowan at (408)435-0239.
Please note that all enrollments are subject to management approval.

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number 
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority 
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in 
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not 
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an 
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing 
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be 
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business 
    Units.

As the final step in the division of responsibilities and personnel 
between the Diversified Controller's and ISG Group Controller's 
organizations, I am pleased to announce the appointment of Jerry L. 
Welsh as head of Commercial Contracts Administration for the 
Diversified Controller.

With MDC since 1972, Jerry originally was involved with governmental 
contracting for McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company and in 1976 
joined the McAuto Commercial Contracts group.  Subsequently he has 
held a series of positions of increasing responsibility within that 
organization and is well prepared to now assume a leadership role in 
the Diversified Controller's organization coordinating contractual 
activities in support of several Business Units - predominately 
Diversified Information Systems Company.

Jerry replaces Richard G. Hatz who, along with James G. McDaniel, 
will form the Contracts policy and coordination section of the ISG 
Group Controller's organization.

In addition to his existing contract development and negotiating 
team, Jerry will also have the Diversified contracts administrative 
groups in St. Louis and Vienna, Virginia reporting to him.

Please join me in wishing Jerry success in his new assignment.

Dallas Operations, Tyrone Hill, (214) 637-7435, System 27.

Problem: PFLLDC crashes, system stays up between 4 min and 2 hrs.
	 Also, DIEREH intersperced over the past 3 days.

Analysis: Nothing positive, system was crashing at PFLLDC in CORE1.
	  Both J and Job reported 0.  Stack showed EXCMPE probably
	  fell into USRFLT then xct PFLLDC at USRFLT+3.  I patched
	  the running monitor & system.sav to determine if the STOPCD
	  was caused by null-job or non-zero LDC.. Added PFLNUL in
	  patch area & system crashed at PFLNUL a while later...

Solution: Still unknown, Steve Atwell in Dallas maintenance tried
	  swapping various boards, the latest were E/UBR and address
	  decoders and after the PFLNUL crash the diagnostics finally
	showed a positive fault in the PI clock interrupt and they
	took over to run diagnostics about 18:00.  Will call me at
	home if it starts crashing again after fixing the problem.
	They feel it is definately HW but wanted help in pin-pointing
	the problem.  (they had replaced all of the pager boards and
	the problem still wouldn't go away).

                                                 April 8, 1986


A message from Bob Fischer to all ISG employees. . .


     Over the past month or so, we have been taking dramatic new 
measures to ensure that ISG meets its 1986 earnings objective.  In 
this message I hope to give you a better idea of what we're doing 
and why.

     Before I go any further, though, I need to make one thing 
clear: By now you probably know that the actions we're taking 
include reductions in ISG's workforce.  I'm not at all happy about 
that, but, for reasons I'll explain in a moment, we've had to cut 
our costs significantly.  Because such a large percentage of our 
total cost is people, force reductions were something we simply 
could not avoid.  I know there is nothing I can say that will be of 
much help to the people affected by these reductions, but I assure 
you we're doing everything we can to help those people find new 
positions elsewhere in MDC or with other companies.

     With that said, let me try to clear up some of the 
misunderstanding caused by the sweeping actions being taken to cut 
costs within ISG.  These actions, most of which are being carried 
out on an individual business unit basis, are designed to give ISG 
a reasonable chance to achieve its earnings objectives in the first 
two quarters as well as for the year.

     Behind these actions is the fact that MDC's top management is 
understandably concerned about ISG's 1985 results.  Rather than 
spend time discussing this here, I want to refer you to the 
newly-published MDC Annual Report.  (A copy will soon be delivered 
to your home if it hasn't been already.)  The ISG section of the 
report, together with Sandy and John McDonnell's discussion of ISG 
in their introductory message to shareholders, does a good job of 
putting our 1985 results into perspective.

     What you need to know here is that MDC is watching our first- 
and second-quarter performance very closely for evidence that we 
have turned things around.  When the ISG Management Committee met 
in February, those first two quarters looked pretty shaky.  (The 
members of this committee, in addition to myself, are: Mike Becker, 
Staff Vice President-Human Resources; Otis Brinkley, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company; Rich Calvert, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
Company; Jerry Causley, President-McDonnell Douglas Information 
Systems International; John Clancy, President-McDonnell Douglasiiness unit identified the 
amount of cost reduction it would need in order to be confident of 
making its own operating plan.  As a group, we then examined every 
alternative we could think of, not only for business unit cuts, but 
also for ISG-wide actions, Group-level cuts, reorganizations, and 
elimination of activities.  From that list, we collectively decided 
on how to achieve the level of savings we need.

     That's a brief look at why we're involved in this round of 
cost cuts and at how we determined where and how much to cut.  Now 
I want to describe some of the actions we're in the process of 
implementing.

     There are four ISG-wide actions.  First, we have suspended all 
merit increases within ISG until the Group is on a much firmer 
financial footing.  The increases will be reinstated only after ISG 
is virtually assured of making its 1986 earnings objective, and 
also after I'm satisfied all business units have taken the 
necessary steps to ensure they are on target to make their 
individual 1986 plans.  At that time, we'll develop a merit program 
that takes into account the fact that some employees have been 
disadvantaged more than othershe size of our group staff, 
both management and professional, by more than 25 percent.  These 
cuts include the elimination of many worthwhile activities that we 
may restore at some point.  For now, though, we just couldn't 
afford to keep them.

     We've also moved to narrow our range of business activities 
and consolidate organizations for more efficient operation.  For 
example, you may have read in the ISG Spirit or elsewhere about the 
dissolution of McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company and 
the restructuring of McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

     All other actions -- about two-thirds of the total -- are 
being taken within individual business units.  These actions vary 
based on what the business units felt they needed to do to achieve 
their objectives.  Along with making their own decisions about 
where to cut costs, the business units are implementing the cuts in 
their own ways and on their own schedules.

     As a result of this decentralized approach, it's hard to see 
the whole picture right now.  Also, the actions being taken aren't 
over with as quickly as if everything were done at oe

   aundown of ts.  But let me tell you something: I believe that our business 
reached its low point on September 30, 1985.  As painful as things 
are now, I believe that on June 30, 1986 -- and for that matter, on 
December 31, 1986 -- we'll look back and see that we've done what 
needed to be done to get ourselves on track.  In the meantime, I'll 
keep you posted.

Sincerely,

Subject: Job Queue - License bits 

We need to maintain some level of control over what entities (persons and
programs) can manipulate the job queue data.  We have at our disposal one
free bit in the privilege word, 3 free bits in the "real" license word and
(I think) 9 or 10 free bits of "pseudo" license.

I propose that we use one of the 3 bits in the license word to allow users
and programs to perform certain "privileged" queue functions, such as insert
delete and setting system-level priorities.  I also think that OP license
may be enough to allow operations to run some programs, but that operators
in general should not have this Queue-Manipulation (QM) license.  Instead a
pseudo license Queue-Administrator (QA) ought to be given them which would
require a TATTLE record to be written with their OPERNAME whenever they need
to change something and programs having QM license would check QA license
before they allow users/processes to do things.

**** Defacto **** Temporarily, in lieu of discussion, I've defined LC.QM as
1B11 (1B29 for frame) for this purpose.  Nothing {SETOP,OPER,MONITOR,etc.}
knows about it (yet), but it's there in the programs being written today.

Comments?  Aspersions?  Complaints?

Subject: Re: Job Queue - License bits 
In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 21 Apr 86 15:25:30 PST

JL license might be reasonable since one having JL license could write their
own PERP to do whatever they want.  One reason to have a new license for the
PERP replacement would be to be able to give it to people you didn't want to
give JL to.  However, since much of the power infered by JL is manifest in an
indirect manner in the queue file, manipulating it is tantamount to JL.  I
also doubt that you'd want to give this new license to anyone who doesn't
already have JL, anyway.  I suppose that manipulating the queue does not give
one indirectly or otherwise the ability to create frames logged in to any
arbitrary PPN as JL does -- in that sense it is considerably less powerful.
If the new PERP validates Usernames/PPN's in the queue file against the LUD
as I have assumed in my last statement, then this would be an argument for
making the new license, and considering it less powerful than JL.

I completely and emphatically agree that the license to directly manipulate
the queue, QM or JL or whatever, be held only by development/systems people.
The kind of access required by operations should be allowed through a program
which holds QM/JL and performs the limited and audited functions on behalf of
an operator validated by OP or some such license.  Being set on the frame may
be enough since the audit trail to the operator name does exist in the stream.

Well, that's the sum total of my babble on the subject.  How's it going?
Need a beta test site?  We have no PERP at all so a flakey one would be
welcome!  I'd even be willing to insert stuff in the queue by hand if
necessary until things solidify.

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which ng and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number

Subject: System 62 status 

System 62 was out of commission due to some scribbling on the disk.

I rewrote APA0's 1st & 2nd HOM pages, copying them from APA1 and
making the appropriate changes.  Then, I re-created a rib page for
(SYS)SAT.SYS and brought the system up to TITO directories (HELGEM)
and (CARL).  The system went through a FULL DKSCLN without any
apparent problems...  If anyone lost files (other than Bill or myself)
I can only offer my sympathy.

Files I created late friday night appeared to be intact, so I doubt
anyone else lost anything.

Dennis Ernst is looking into the micronode problems... please record
any fatal node error messages, and if "1000G" works, or if the node
doesn't crash, please login as "XRAY:ST@" from the node's CTY and do
a "C" command.  Record the number "V=255,2" (for example) with the
fatal error.  At the moment, version 255,2 is the proper new version.

My understanding is that RMURPHY is working on the TUMS project... but
I don't know who he is or why he should have a GAN 3 username.  Another
GAN should be setup for this project or he should have a GAN from NTD,
not TYMCOM-X.  I realise that someone just did a GAN change on that user
but GAN 3 should NOT have been used.  Please rectify this, or have Ken
Jones (or whomever is running the show contact me).

Subject: System 62 - Events 

During an attempt to do the all-files on 62, we kept losing vacuum on
the tape drive.  Steve Capik was called but has not yet arrived to date.

Last night, we decided to try the Kennedy 9400 drive that Dan & Eric
had sitting on the cart to see if it really was compatible and whether
the F3 could handle it.  Apparently, under timesharing, the 9400 works
just fine at 1600 or 6250 bpi.

Due to lack of an available working 9100 drive, we decided to see how much
tape an all-files took at 6250 and started the all-files.  It completed
this afternoon, and with the exception of one tape (accidently) written at
1600 bpi, the save took 6.5 tapes.  (5.5 @ 6250, 1 @ 1600).

I believe that the all-files takes less time as well, but we didn't really
perform any accurate timing tests.

/Carl

PS... it would be nice to be able to use a 9400 on one of our systems for
      all of the backups.....

Subject: Weirdies on system 62 

Joe,
    System 62 has some really weird problems with job #3, #5 and #7.  It
is possible that I can replicate the problem even further, but it tears
the system apart with "?error in detached job..." messages to the CTY
and OPR terminals, eating up to 60% of the CPU.  The IRONY is that SYSTAT
doesn't show anything.

  I was about to logoff and ran SY to see things at a glance, and WHOA..
there are 3 jobs, detached, running logout in ^C state.  So I try killing
them first with LOGOUT, then DDT and the HANG uuo, then TAKEIT... no dice
so I go to reload the system...  OOPS!

  Takeit sets the current terminal to OPR, and >Zap< >Zing< >Zowie< there
comes a flood of "?error in detached job..." messages all over the place.
Tons and tons of them... I finally got out of TAKEIT and zapped the OPR
port.  I then attached to the 3 jobs one at a time, couldn't run anything
at all (seems like no context pages? or something?) ...anyway, CORE 0 did
work, and by attaching, the "?error..." messages stopped going to the CTY
and OPR terminals.

  Jobs are still there, detached... I wanted to make sure we could get a
good crash somehow before we reload it.  Even if it means patching a good
copy of BOOTS into the monitor!!!

I'll be in TYMNET TTE.110 class next week but
you are welcome to have a TYMCOM-X meeting anyway.  All the
classrooms are booked for Tuesday so I reserved classroom
2 for 10:00 to 12:00 on Wednesday June 4.

Subject: System 62 - XEXEC 

XEXEC is now running on system 62  from (CARL).  If the system gets
reloaded, the version in SYS is the same version and should run the
same.  It is somewhat working... feel free to pound on it.

/Carl

Please only use SUBMIT to pound on it...  If it is seen that XEXEC is not
running, please look at the CTY for ominous messages and restart it from
SYS:.  Thanks.
