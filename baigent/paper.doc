                           Lysergic Acid Diethylamide                           ________ ____ ____________


     Since its discovery in 1943, lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD,  has  been

one of the most controversial drugs known to man.  The controversy lays not only

in the risks and benefits of LSD, but in the action of the drug  itself.   After

more than forty years of study, much of the action of the drug in the human body

is still a mystery.  In minute doses, LSD has proven to  be  the  most  powerful

hallucinogen  ever discovered and yet its exact effect on the brain is still not

understood.  The study of LSD, therefore, is as much a study of  its  scientific

controversy as it is the study of the effects of the xenobiotic know as lysergic

acid diethylamide.


The History of LSD___ _______ __ ___


     LSD  was  first  synthesized  by  Sandoz  Research  Laboratories  of  Basel

Switzerland  in  1938  [1].   The  drug  was  developed  as  part of a series of

experiments designed to investigate the potential uses of compounds derived from

the  ergot  fungus,  Claviceps  purpurea.   It  was  discovered that very slight

changes in the chemical structure of these  compounds  produced  widely  varying

results  in the effects these compounds had on laboratory animals [2].  One such

compound,  lysergic  acid,  had  a  whole  series   of   synthetic   derivatives

collectively  know  as  the  lysergates.   Dr.   Albert  Hofmann had generated a

semi-synthetic compound as part of a  systematic  pharmacological  investigation

into  the  properties of the amides of lysergic acid.  The twenty-fifth compound

in the experimental series was lysergic acid  diethylamide  and  was  code-named

LSD-25.   The  compound  was  chemically  similar  to  a  well known circulatory

stimulant called nikethamide and Dr. Hofmann had expected the compound to reveal

                                                                          Page 2
                                                                     Dan Baigent


similar analeptic properties [2].


     During  some  experimentations  with  the  compound  in  1943,  Dr. Hofmann

accidently  ingested  some of the drug and was forced to stop his work as he was

"seized  by  a  peculiar  restlessness  associated  with  a  sensation  of  mild

dizziness"  [1].   Dr. Hofmann  correctly induced that the experience was due to

ingestion  of  the  LSD-25  compound  and   decided   to   conduct   some   self

experimentation with the drug.  He administered himself a dose of .25 milligrams

of LSD, what is now known to be many times the required  hallucinogenic  amount.

He  summarized  the  outstanding  symptoms as "...vertigo;  visual disturbances;

marked motoric  unrest;   dry,  constricted  sensation  in  the  throat;   clear

recognition  of my condition.  Occasionally I felt as if I were out of my body."

[3].  Dr. Hofmann concluded by noting that there were no noticeable side effects

of the drug and that he returned to "normal" the following day.  


     After publishing  the  discoveries  of  LSD-25's  psychoactive  properties,

experimentation with LSD on both humans and lab animals spread to all corners of

the  scientific,  psychiatric  and   philosophical   worlds.    Initially,   the

"recreational"  use  of  LSD  was  limited  to writers, poets, artists and other

"visionaries" who experimented with the drug to experience its  "mind-expanding"

properties.   The  relative  ease  with  which LSD is synthesized and the minute

amounts required to induce hallucinations caused it to eventually become a major

illicit drug.


Chemical Properties of LSD________ __________ __ ___


     LSD is a relatively simple compound that differs  only  slightly  from  the

other  lysergic  acid amides.  Despite their close structural relationship, most

of the other amides show little if any of the marked  hallucinogenic  properties

of LSD.  Of the lysergic acid group, acetyl lysergic acid (ALD-52) comes closest

                                                                          Page 3
                                                                     Dan Baigent


to LSD in psychoactive properties, but is still only about half as active [4].  


     The chemical structure of LSD is similar to that  of  the  neurotransmitter

serotonin  and  LSD,  along with many of the other lysergates, is known to be an

antagonist  of  serotonin.   It  was  widely  believed   that   the   structural

relationship   between   serotonin   and  LSD  is  instrumental  to  the  drug's

psychoactivity, but there seemed  to  be  no  direct  relationship  between  the

psychological   properties   of  the  various  lysergates  and  their  serotonin

antagonism [4].


     In  1959,  the  published  work  of  Szent-Gyorgyi  postulated   that   the

psychoactive properties of LSD, serotonin and other hallucinogenic compounds was

due to their ability to act as electron  donors  and  that  their  hierarchy  of

effect  corresponded  to  their  orbital  energy  rather  than  their  molecular

structure.  Although further studies continue, the study  of  a  drug's  quantum

electrical  properties  in  the body is extremely complicated.  As of yet, there

has been no conclusive evidence that a compound's molecular energy  is  directly

correlated to psycho or biological activity [5].


Physical effects of LSD________ _______ __ ___


     The LD50 for LSD is highly species-dependant, ranging from .3 mg/kg/bw  for

the  most sensitive animal (rabbit) to 46 mg/kg/bw for the most resistant animal

(mouse) [6].  If the rabbit's LD50 is extrapolated for the  average  human,  the

LD50 would be about 20 mg/kg/bw [4].  The effective dose in humans has proven to

be about 20 micrograms, or .02 mg, therefore death due to overdose has yet to be

reported  for  LSD.  Fatalities associated with LSD consumption have mostly been

attributed to the psychological effects of the drug (accidental  or  intentional

suicides, etc) or a combination of the effects of other drugs.

                                                                          Page 4
                                                                     Dan Baigent


     LSD has been found to produce tolerance in human subjects but the  duration

of  such  tolerance  appears  to  be as short as 72 hours [3].  Furthermore, LSD

produces cross-tolerance to a variety of drugs including  mescaline,  psilocybin

and  other  psychoactive compounds, although studies into the mechanisms of this

cross-tolerance have been inconclusive [7].  Due  to  its  short  duration,  LSD

tolerance has not been considered an important factor in the abuse of the drug.


     Physiologically, there is very little  evidence  of  dependence  associated

with  the  use of LSD.  Psychological dependence has been found among some heavy

"street" users, but there is little if  any  evidence  of  withdrawal  symptoms,

either  physical  or  psychological,  supporting  the  concept  that  LSD is not

addictive.  Many long-term LSD users have simply grown bored by  the  experience

leading  to  the  conclusion  that  even  psychological  dependence  tends to be

self-limiting [1].


     Perhaps the most serious implications of the physical effects of  LSD  come

from the studies done on chromosomal damage.  The majority of these studies have

shown  marked  increases  in  chromosomal  abnormalities  "in   vitro"   (in   a

laboratory).   The  studies  performed "in vivo" (in a living subject or animal)

have been laden with controversy over such factors as the role played  by  other

drugs,  the  route of application, the applicability of dose and the validity of

the statistical treatment of results.  The most extensive study  of  chromosomal

damage  conducted  by  N. I. Dishotsky (and associates) in 1970 concluded that 6

out of 9 "in vitro" studies showed some degree of chromosome  damage  while  the

other  3  were inconclusive.  Of the 310 "in vivo" human subjects, only 126 were

treated with pure LSD, the rest received  illicit  "street"  LSD.   The  results

showed  that  14.29%  of  the  pure  LSD recipients showed higher frequencies of

chromosome abberations as opposed to 48.9% of the illicit LSD recipients [9].

                                                                          Page 5
                                                                     Dan Baigent


     The results for the recipients of "street" LSD have been attributed  mostly

to  the  fact  that  illicit  LSD  is  rarely  pure.   Contaminants ranging from

methamphetamines to toxic floor cleaners have been detected in  samples  of  LSD

obtained  on  the  street.   The results of the pure LSD recipients have largely

been shown to be statistically insignificant.  Dishotsky also pointed  out  that

the mutagenic effects were notable at doses of 12 to 60 grams per human subject,

many thousand times the effective dose.  The conclusions  of  this  study  were,

therefore,  that  the mutagenic and teratagenic properties of LSD did not pose a

serious threat [9].


Psychological Effects of LSD_____________ _______ __ ___


     By far the most intriguing and controversial aspect of LSD is  the  effects

it  has  on the human mind.  Aside from the physiological changes induced by the

drug, such as increased heart rate,  mydriasis,  decreased  blood  pressure  and

increased body temperature, LSD has very pronounced effects on perception, mood,

behavior and even self-image [4].  The magnitude of these effects  is  dependant

not only on the dose ingested, but more importantly on the existing mental state

of the user and the environment in which the drug is experienced.


     A study published in 1972 showed  how  subjects  of  similar  personalities

responded  to  the  ingestion  of  LSD.   The  study  employed  the double-blind

methodology  and  used  pre-drug  investigations  to  categorize  the   subjects

according  to  personality traits.  The subjects were then given LSD or placebos

and the personality investigations were conducted  a  second  time.   Among  the

conclusions of the study was the discovery that persons of similar personalities

had  similar  responses  to  the  influence  of  LSD.    Additionally,   certain

personality  traits  such  as  openess,  flexibility  and high self-esteem could

predict whether a person would find the  experience  pleasurable  or  not.   The

                                                                          Page 6
                                                                     Dan Baigent


study  also  concluded  that LSD was not, as was popularly believed, responsible

for any increase in natural creativity or self-awareness [10].


     Because of its relative high therapeutic index, LSD has often been explored

for  possible  benefits  in  such areas as the treatment of mental disorders and

psychotherapy.  Under psycholytic therapy, patients have been known to  overcome

mental  and  emotional  blocks  which  had  hindered  their  ability  to acheive

rehabilitation [8].  LSD has also been known to  aid  in  regression  and  other

abreactions  that  have  helped  therapists to acheive better understanding of a

patient's condition.   One  such  episode  was  documented  where  a  young  man

regressed  to  "a  small,  helpless child subject to titilation of the navel and

genitalia and other  kinds  of  trauma"  which  helped  the  psychotherapist  to

overcome the patients history of impotence [8].


Conclusion__________


     The nature of LSD has made it fascinating to the scientific  community  for

decades.   Although  the  abuse  of  LSD,  as  with any drug, has proven to be a

problem in this country and around the world, most  members  of  the  scientific

community  feel  LSD has an important role to play in research.  There are still

so many unanswered  questions  about  the  drug  such  as  how  it  effects  the

biochemistry  of the brain, how it is metabolized, how it relates to other drugs

and how it effects mental processes, that the answers  to  these  questions  can

only lead to a better understanding of biochemistry in general.
