PEAK Reference Guide               Version 1.0                       Page 1


    This is a brief guide to the screen editor PEAK.  Other available 
    documentation includes (sysnews)peak.key and (sysnews)peak.cht.
    Peak.key contains a list of commands by key bindings.  Peak.cht
    is a chart (132 characters wide) of bindable keys with the PEAK
    default function bindings.  This file can be printed out or copied
    to your directory and used to keep track of additional bindings.

Use of PEAK

    PEAK is intended for Tymshare internal use only.

Accessing PEAK

    PEAK is accessible by the monitor command 'PEAK'.  The 
    complete command is PEAK [filename] [/Pn] [/Ln] [/R] where
    /Pn is the page number on which to start editing, /Ln is the
    line number on which to start editing and /R will read in 
    the file "Read Only" (no modification allowed).  

Terminal Type

    If you do not have tty class set, PEAK will ask for your terminal
    type.  If you are not sure what your terminal type is, typing "?" 
    at the "Terminal type?" prompt will give a list of supported terminals.

Inserting

    All normally printing characters insert themselves when typed.
    This includes RETURN and TAB.  To insert a control character
    you must "quote" it with ^Q.

    ^Q              Insert the next character                       [Quote]

Moving Around - Basic Cursor Movement

    ^F              Move forward                                  [Forward]
    ^B              Move backward                                [Backward]
    ^A              Move to beginning of line           [Beginning of Line]
    ^E              Move to end of line                       [End of Line]
    ^N              Move to next line                                [Down]
    ^P              Move to previous line                              [Up]

    ESC F           Move forward over token                 [Forward Token]
    ESC B           Move backward over token               [Backward Token]

    You can think of a "token" as being a word or a number.  To have other
    characters included with the word or number, define them as tokens or
    numbers with the "Is Token" or "Is Number" command (see page 6).  Your
    peak.ini is a good place to define token characters.

    ESC {           Move to top of page                       [Top of Page]
    ESC }           Move to bottom of page                 [Bottom of Page]

Moving Around in the Window

    Unless you have split the screen into two windows, "window" is 
    synonymous with "screen" in the following commands.

    ESC ,           Move to top of window                   [Top of Window]
    ESC .           Move to end of window                [Bottom of Window]
    ^V              Move to next window                    [Forward Window]
    ESC V           Move to previous window               [Backward Window]
    ^Z              Scroll window up                     [Scroll Window Up]
    ESC Z           Scroll window down                 [Scroll Window Down]
    ESC !           Move point to top of window     [Line to Top of Window]

Moving Around in the Buffer

    PEAK does not edit the file itself; it reads the file into a buffer and
    all editing is done there.

    ESC <           Move to top of buffer                   [Top of Buffer]
    ESC >           Move to end of buffer                [Bottom of Buffer]

    ESC <space>     Set a "mark" in the buffer                   [Set Mark]

    Up to ten marks can be set.  All mark commands can be given an argument
    to specify which mark will be referenced by the command.  For example,
    "ESC <space>" sets mark 0, "^U 5 ESC <space>" would set mark 5.

    ESC G           Go to a mark                                [Goto Mark]
    ^X S            Exchange the point and a mark               [Swap Mark]

    "Point" is the present position of the cursor.

Deleting

    ^D              Delete character                               [Delete]
    ^H              Delete previous character             [Delete Backward]

    ESC D           Delete token                     [Delete Token Forward]
    ESC H           Delete previous token           [Delete Token Backward]

    ^K              Kill line                                   [Kill Line]
    ESC K           Kill to end of line                 [Kill Partial Line]

    ^K kills the line from point to end of line including the cr-lf at the
    end of the line, ESC K kills either the line from point to end of line,
    or the cr-lf.  Note:  ESC K will not kill a form feed, ^K will.  Giving
    ESC K a large argument will kill to the end of the page and stop there.

    ^W              Kill to a mark                            [Wipe Region]
    ^Y              Recover killed text                [Insert Kill Buffer]

    All text killed without moving the cursor will be in the kill buffer.
    After moving the cursor, a subsequent kill will delete the previous 
    contents of the kill buffer and replace it with the most recent kill.

    ESC Q           Query change                             [Query Change]

    Responses to the query change command are: "Y","y", or <space> - yes,
    change this string;  "." - change this string and stop; "^G" - stop.
    Any other character continues searching without replacing the target 
    string.
    
    ESC M           Multiple string search                [Multiple Search]

    "ESC M <string1> ESC <string2> ESC ... <stringn> ESC ESC" is the 
    complete command; n is any number up to 10.  You can repeat the search
    with "ESC M ESC".

    ^X ^U           Recover last checkpoint            [Recover Checkpoint]

    You can force a checkpoint by ^X ^S, and then edit, knowing you can 
    return to the state of the file at the checkpoint by ^X ^U.  The file
    will be automatically checkpointed if there have been no changes for 
    the number of seconds set as the checkpoint interval, or if you move
    to another file in the buffer chain.

Special Character Searching

    ESC :           Reverse search for "special" character 
                                                   [Reverse Special Search]
    ESC ;           Search for "special" character         [Special Search]

Defining Special Characters/Tokens

    ESC X is special ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as "special" character for ESC ; and
                    ESC : commands
    ESC X is number ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as "number" for ESC B, ESC F, ESC H
                    and ESC D commands
    ESC X is token ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as "token" for ESC B, ESC F, ESC H
                    and ESC D commands
    ESC X is delim ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as "delim" for ESC B, ESC F, ESC H
                    and ESC D commands.  A delim is the opposite of a
                    "token" for these commands.

    All four have a "not" form also; "not special", "not number",
    "not token, and "not delim", which will undo the definition.

Executing Functions by Name

    ESC X           Execute a function by name

    The complete form is "ESC X <function name> ESC".  All functions
    in PEAK have a symbolic name.  The symbolic names have been given
    in brackets for all functions.  Some functions are not bound to
    keys, and must be accessed symbolically.  They are:

    Center Line          Centers current line with margins set
    Indent Region        Indents region from point to mark 0
    Unindent Region      Unindents region from point to mark 0
    Token UC             For use with "toggle case" command
    Token LC             For use with "toggle case" command
    Window Bar           Sets character(s) for window bar
    Delete NULLs         Delete NULLs in file
    XOFF Synch           Allows XON/XOFF handshaking
    Nothing              Does nothing
    Beep                 Rings bell

Setting the Argument

    Every command is passed a numeric argument which, unless set
    explicity, is zero.  The argument tells most commands to
    do themselves that many times (except that the default of zero
    means to do themselves once).  The argument is also used with
    commands dealing with marks to specify which of the ten marks
    to use.

    To set the argument type ^U followed by a number.  The next
    command typed will be passed that number.  If no number is
    typed a default "multiplier" will be used.  The default value
    of the multiplier is 4.  Hence the command string ^U10^F will
    send the argument 10 to ^F, which in turn will cause it to move
    forward over 10 characters.  The string ^U^F would send the
    default argument of 4.

    The current value of the argument will be displayed on the message
    line when the ^U command is given.  For example, the default
    number of 4 will be shown when ^U is typed.  If ^U is followed
    by the number 10, the message line will then display "Arg: 10".

    Arguments can be multiplied.  If an argument is passed to ^U it
    will multiply it against the next argument given.  The string
    ^U10^U3^N first sends an argument of 10 to ^U, which multiplies
    that against 3, and passes 30 to ^N, which will then move down
    30 lines.  Likewise, ^U^U^N will move down 16 lines.

    The multiplier may be changed to some number other than 4 by the
    assign environment variable command "Un^X _ <variable name> ESC".

Peak.ini

    When PEAK starts up it looks for a file named "PEAK.INI" on
    your logged in directory (NOT the GFD'd directory) for special
    initialization commands.  A PEAK.INI should start by locking
    the file so that stray characters in PEAK.INI won't cause
    inadvertant modiions to the buffer.  

    A sample PEAK.INI, which sets the indentation width to 6,
    defines a macro to go to the top of the next page, and binds
    the macro to Meta-P and Meta-p, is:

        ^X-
        ^X| Lock file |

        ^X| Sample PEAK.INI |

        ^X| set the indentation width to 6 |
        ^U6^X_IndentWidth$

        ^X| define a macro to get to the top of the next page |
        ^Xd/$}^N/

        ^X| bind the macro to Meta-P and Meta-p |
        ^Xm$P
        ^Xm$p

        ^X| Unlock file|
        ^X+             

    NOTE:  There is NO carriage return at the end of the last line.

Status and Message Lines

    The status line at the bottom of the editing window gives the following
    information:  Editor name  Version number (Terminal type  Major mode
    [+],  [Wrap]  [Over])  [<]  File name  [>]  - Cursor position in file - 
    [*]  [$]  with:
        Major mode  Text or Normal
        +           Executed peak.ini
        Wrap        Wrap flag set
        Over        Overwrite flag set
        <           Previous buffer(s) in buffer chain
        >           Subsequent buffer(s) in buffer chain
        *           Buffer modified flag
        $           File read only

    Cursor position is given in percent of file before the cursor, or
    Top or End.

    Below the status line, the message line gives prompts and information
    from PEAK.

Continuing PEAK after Attaching to Detached Job

    If you are dropped in the middle of an edit, have detach on disconnect
    set and it was not a host crash, you can continue your edit without
    losing anything when you are able to log in again.  Attach to your
    detached job, ESC (or ^C if you are in PDP10 mode), continue, and
    then ^L.  The ^L not only refreshes the screen, but also will reset 
    your terminal characteristics for the duration of the edit.

Backup Files

    PEAK will write a file with the extension "bak" for each file you
    edit.  When you write out your edited buffer with either ^X^W or
    ^X^F, PEAK renames the original file to <filename>.bak, after
    deleting the old <filename>.bak (if one exists), and then writes 
    out the current edit.

    Thus the .bak file normally will contain a copy of the file before 
    you began the current edit.  However, if you write out the file in
    the middle of your edit with a ^X^W, the .bak file will contain
    the file at the state of the previous write.

    Should you be editing more than one file with the same name (but 
    different extensions) read into different buffers, the .bak file
    will contain a backup for only one of the files.
