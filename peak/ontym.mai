Ken,
     It would be really helpful to me if you could track and report
actual hours on the monthly status reports.  Stuart expects that kind of
a breakdown from me -- I input everyone's hours into a spreadsheet so I
can produce some statistics.  (I guess I need to circulate my report as
well as the NTD reports.)  Thanks for your cooperation.

I just (8-Oct) got a message from FSC.SUP saying something about file
transfer from PDP-X to the FSC Ontyme account using a file called:
  ACCESS.ONT  which contains

  username;EMSFSC
  ACCOUNT.FSC
  ONTYME NAME F/LastName

Do you know anything about anything that would use such a mechanism?

Subject:  ISIS Dispatcher changes
 
==============================================================================
 
The latest version of ISIS (version 7.00), which will be released to Baseline
this January, contains a change in the Dispatcher interface that anyone who
writes code under ISIS should be aware of.
 
The new Dispatcher checks to make sure that slots do not try to output an
illegal message on a port that is in login state.  Login state applies to
normal circuits being built out and is the time between the receipt of the
Pseudo-Needle message (type B2) and the receipt of the Login OK (type B6) or
Login Failed message (type B5).  The only messages that can legally be sent
during this time are Logon Char (B3), Zapper (9F), Detach (9E), Zap w/Reason
(BE), Backpressure On (A0), and Backpressure Off (A1).  An attempt to send
any other message will cause the slot to be crashed with a Dispatcher Crash.
 
The new Dispatcher also makes the reverse check.  It will crash a slot that
attempts to send a Logon Char message (B3) on a port that is not in logon
state.
 
This is NOT a protocol change; these rules have always been in effect, but
the old Dispatcher did not enforce them.  There are still some slot programs
that violate these rules, but have gotten away with it up to now.  Please
make sure that your code follows the above rules.  You can use ISIS version
7.00 from the Betatest directory to help.  This way we can all avoid a lot
of pain in January.

Subject:  ONTYME SYSTEMS APPOINTMENT



I am pleased to announce the appointment of Richard C. Gunther 
to the position of General Manager, Ontyme Systems, in the newly 
formed McDonnell Douglas Electronic Messaging Systems Company 
(MDEMS, a part of Network Systems Company).  Dick will report to 
Terry Donaher, Vice President, MDEMS.

Dick brings over 25 years of experience in the computing and 
communications industries to MDEMS.  Over the past four years, 
he has made many contributions to the strategic plans of Tymnet 
and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group, most 
recently by chairing the ISG Communications Opportunities Task 
Force and by spearheading the effort to create MDEMS.  He was 
instrumental in the acquisition of FTC Communications, the other 
principal component of MDEMS.

During the balance of 1985, Dick will focus on developing a 1986 
operating plan for Ontyme Systems, and organizing the business 
unit to start the new year with increased momentum.

The recent announcement of the formation of MDEMS stressed that 
a key to ISG's success will be how well MDEMS works with all the 
other business units to distribute its products and services.  
Dick is making this his top priority.  Please join me in 
welcoming him to MDEMS and give him your full support in his 
efforts to achieve our mutual objectives.

OPERATIONS INITIATED ITEMS:


1.  QA of Restore Version 1.07 - NTD is investigating a problem in
    the number of copies restored for aliases and a duplicate message
    restoration problem caused by using the 'replace' keyword.

2.  QA and Release of Osiris 21.03 - 21.03 was released from QA
    Friday.  Host 832 was upgraded Monday evening with a 12 NCB
    port capak Node Move and Future Expansion - All Railtrack node
    moves have been completed and additional floor space is available
    for future OnTyme expansion.


MARKETING INITIATED ITEMS:


1.  Status of 21.03 Deployment - Marketing reported a reliable
    machine interface problem with the new 'all text messages
    read' format.  Steps are underway to incorporate a change in
    Osiris 21.04; hence further deployment of 21.03 is unlikely.

2.  Osiris 22.00 - Marketing expressed concern in the content and role
    of the GED's with respect to QA.  NTD indicated that all changes
    would be appropriately reflected in the GED and GID's.

Items Pending:

    1.  Inter-OnTyme account move capability.
    2.  Justification for additional h/w for expansion.

Following is a list of Tymnet to Bubbnet gateway hosts.  You can use
these host numbers to build a circuit through a particular gateway.
To do this, enter:

    <your username>:<gateway host number>;<password>

at the please login prompt or:

    ;c   <your username>:<gateway host number>

when building a circuit from NAD.

The gateway hosts are:

    390, 1461, 1579, 2633, 5516, and 7255.

There are others listed as gateway hosts, but I haven't been able to

2       An explanation of each field which does not assume I know what is

Addiction in Users of Computer Mail Systems

                      Philip L. Budne

   Boston University

Digital Equipment Corporation

This paper is the  result  of  research  performed  as part of an undergraduate
directed study at Boston University.  Computer Mediated  Communication
literature  has  indicated a potential for addiction in users of Computer  Mail
 systems.   A questionnaire  was  designed  to  characterize the nature of the
addiction.  Self identified  addicts were  recruited  with  public  messages on
several nationwide computer networks.   The  questionnaire was then distributed
and returned using electronic mail.

     Modern electronic computer  networks  offer  users  the
ability to deliver messages with greater ease and speed than
ever before.  Distant friends and colleagues  can  continue,
or  establish  communication on a daily basis without regard
to differences in time zone or schedules.  Messages  can  be
sent  across  the  globe  in  minutes  and  be  read  at the
recipient's choice  of  time  and  location.   Messages  are
devoid  of visual, verbal, and non-verbal contact; there are
no physical cues, no handwriting, or  even  paper  that  has
been  touched  by  the  sender.  The only traditional medium
that begins to offer the equivalent speed, freedom, and phy-
sical  record  of  computer  mail  is the Telegram.  However
Telegrams are far more expensive  and  not  nearly  as  con-
venient.   It is not surprising therefore that computer mail
(or computer mediated communication) should  have  affective
and behavioral impacts differing from traditional communica-
tion channels.

     One effect on users of electronic message systems  that
has  been  observed  is the potential for addiction. (Hiltz,
1978) A possible definition for this addiction is  returning
to  the  terminal,  more  than...  work of information alone
would at first seem to justify . (Kerr, 1982)

     Several reasons for this phenomena have been suggested.
The  first is that electronic communication is a highly pro-
fitable behavior.  For little cost, or  outlay  of  physical
effort  a user can receive far more messages than they send.
A second theory is that because of the high availability  of
information  users  can  become overloaded easily. (Kleiner,
1979) To avoid this situation the user  feels  compelled  to
check  for messages more frequently.  The last hypothesis is
that electronic mail is attractive to individuals  who  feel
awkward   communicating   using   traditional   means.   The
anonymous  nature  of  computer  mediated  communication  is
disinhibiting (Festinger, 1952) and allows them a freedom of
expression they do not usually enjoy.  To examine the  above
ideas  it  was  decided  to  issue  a questionnaire to self-
identified addicts.

METHOD

     Use of the word  addiction  was  carefully  considered.
Although  it has negative connotations, it is clearly under-
stood, and is less negative  than  nerd  or  obsessive.   To
recruit  volunteers a ten item preliminary questionnaire was
posted with a  request  that  the  message  be  reposted  to
interested  parties.   The  message asked for users who felt
that they were addicted to electronic mail.  The  definition
of  addiction  was  left  unqualified.  It was felt that the
perception of addiction was subjective and might well differ
from  subject  to  subject.   A  total of 136 responses were
received, from 116 males and 20 females; 47  were  from  the
ARPAnet  community,  12 from Boston University Computer Sci-
ence systems, 26 from users of the Digital Equipment  inter-
nal  ENet,  and 51 from users on systems connected via UUCP.
The final questionnaire was then designed  with  refinements
from the preliminary answers.

     The questionnaire contained 70  questions;  28  initial
demographic  and  usage pattern questions, 26 questions on a
five point likert scale on  attitudes  regarding  electronic
and  traditional media, and 16 open ended questions evaluat-
ing the subject's feelings about their  addiction.   Of  136
full  questionnaires sent out, 66 replies were received; two
were explicit refusals to answer the questions, and one  was
answered  a  quarter  of  the way through before the subject
quit.  The remaining 63 responses were coded, for an overall
yield of 46%.

     An attempt was made to recruit subjects  on  the  large
campus IBM system, as a very broad spectrum of the undergra-
duate population have accounts on  the  system.  Many  users
appear to log in to the system just to use the mail facility
called "$MSG".  However no subjects returned the full  ques-
tionnaire.

RESULTS

     Of the 70 questionnaire items 61 were analyzed.  Of the
63  Ss, 55 were male (87%), and 8 were female (12%).  The Ss
came from 17 states of the U.S.,  1  Canadian  province  and
three  foreign countries (Holland, Norway, and Switzerland).
One subject returned their answers by postal mail, all  oth-
ers  used electronic mail.  The range for ages was 19 to 50,
the modal age was 28, with a mean of 29.2, variance of  7.1.
The  average  user  has  been using computers for 10.5 years
(mode 10, variance 4.7), but has been  using  computers  for
communications  for a mean of 5.3 years (modes 2,5, variance
3.3). 86% use computers extensively in the line of work, 35%
have  family  members  that use electronic mail, and 22% use
electronic mail to communicate  with  family  members.   The
biggest use of computers was Systems programming (20%), fol-
lowed by text preparation,  and  computer  science  research
(both  19%); 11% used computers primarily for communication.
39% said their primary community was the  ARPA/MILnet/CSnet,
30%  said  usenet/UUCP,  and  22%  were users of the Digital
internal EasyNet.

     A large number of Ss felt they had started  using  Com-
puters  in general because of school (46%), followed by per-
sonal interest (39%), only 11% felt they had  started  using
computers  because of their job.  However 42% felt that they
had started to use computers for  communication  because  of
their  job,  44% from personal interest, and only 9% because
of school; 60% felt that their addiction had been caused  by
use of electronic communication in their work setting.

     The average user spends  44  hours/week  on-line  (mode
45hrs  (16%),  variance  of  18,  range 10 to 80).  For most
users 90% of this time is business related, the other 10% is
recreational;  10%  of  the tie on line is spent in business
related communication, and 10%  in  recreational  communica-
tion.   The  average addict logs in 10 times/week explicitly
for communications purposes (range 0  to  30).   Most  users
(mode)  receive  about 10 business related messages per week
(range 0 to 300), but send less than 5  (range  0  to  100).
Most users (mode) receive about 5 personal messages (range 0
to 400) and send about 5  (range  0  to  200).   Most  users
(mode)  read  about  200  public news/discussion group/NOTES
messages per week (range 0 to 4000), and the majority  (61%)
send less than 5.

     Subjects were asked to rate (on  a  five  point  likert
scale) how they would feel talking to a crowd, group, single
person, or using electronic mail for crowds,  groups,  etc..
consisting  of  friends  or  strangers.  For crowds, groups,
etc. consisting of friends the majority of  subjects  agreed
strongly  that they would feel comfortable addressing such a
group; electronic mail generated the largest number of  such
responses  (84%), with single friend (79%), group of friends
(77%), and crowd of friends (52%) following.  Speaking to  a
group  of  strangers  did  show a minor split; 32% responded
mildly agree, 29% responded mildly disagree.  The  responses
for  strongly  agree  for crowds, groups, etc showed a large
jump for electronic mail;  crowds  14%,  group  15%,  single
stranger 17%, electronic mail 41%.

     There was a strong consensus  for  "I  enjoy  receiving
postal  mail"; 49% responded strongly agree, while there was
a trend towards disagree for "I enjoy sending postal  mail".
There  was  also  a  division for "I would like it if postal
mail was delivered more than once a day",  with  39  on  the
agree side, 26% on the disagree side, and 30% in the middle.
There was a strong consensus for strongly agree to  both  "I
enjoy receiving electronic mail" (53%), and "I enjoy sending
electronic mail" (57%).  For the statement "I dislike  sign-
ing  on  and  finding  a very large number of messages", the
response was negative (63% disagree).

     55% felt that they often signed on  because  they  felt
"something might be waiting".  There was a slightly negative
response to the statement "I check for messages before I  go
to sleep".  The was a strong negative response to the state-
ments "I find my  involvement  with  computer  communication
interferes  with  other  social  activities", and "I find my
involvement with computer communication interferes with many
of my other activities (such as eating)"; over 70% responded
rarely or very rarely, 20% responded sometimes.

     34% of subjects reported  sometimes  feeling  irritated
when  the  system  was not available when they tried to sign
on; 20% said sometimes they showed signs of physical arousal
when  the  system  went down, but 44% said very rarely (most
negative).  20% reported they often felt the need to log  in
to avoid getting too many messages, while 38% reported feel-
ing this way very rarely.  55% reported that they often used
electronic mail when they could have made a phone call.  The
most often reported reason for this was to avoid  "Telephone
Tag", and to avoid interrupting the recipient.  However sub-
jects felt they rarely used electronic mail when they  could
have  had  a  face-to-face conversation.  There was a strong
negative response (79% said rarely) to the statement "I feel
the  need  to  get away from electronic communication".  The
majority of respondents (56%) said they rarely  were  logged
in between midnight and 5 am.

     The majority (84%) said that very  often  checking  for
electronic mail was the first thing they did in the morning;
77% of the population have terminals at home,  85%  reported
very often checking mail first thing in the morning.  Of the
remaining subjects  without  terminals  at  home  78%  still
reported  very  often checking mail first thing in the morn-
ing.

     When asked how many messages they could receive without
annoyance  37%  of  the  population  said  they had no upper
limit, 31.5% of the population had a limit of less  than  or
equal to 20 messages.  For public messages 36% said they had
no upper limit, 36.1% of the population had an  upper  limit
of  less timwer.

 find i52% said 3% said yesto answ wau be willing to  participate
in an interview?" 88% said yes, 11% said no.

CONCLUSIONS

     There are a number of questions I would have  liked  to
have asked that either were forgotten in the design process,
were suggested by subjects, or  came  up  in  analyzing  the
results;

   Would you send a love letter using computer mail?

   Do you ever carry a terminal when you travel?

   Have you ever been cut off from use of computer mail?

   What was your reaction?

   Do you ever see someone and say "I'll send you a message"?

   Have you had  problems  with  your  spouse  (or  significant other)
   regarding your addiction to computer mail?

   Do you feel you are better understood using computer mail?

   Do you ever use the telephone when you could  have  a  face-to-face
   conversation?

     And similarly there are many questions that I would not
have  asked,  or  asked  more  explicitly.  A data item that
could have been coded for analysis was  not  a  question  by
itself;  subjects  that  volunteered  for the interview were
asked to give a way contact them.  It should have been  pos-
sible  to  tabulate  the  type of "adds  useful  indicator
for other characteristics.

     An additional idea that bears more investigation is the
concept  that  computer  mail  addiction may 'mature'; users
become fanatical at first exposure, and slowly adapt  habits
that integrate use of electronic mail into daily life.

     There was little evidence  of  overload,  and  overload
induced  'dropout' (Kleiner, 1981) in the population.  It is
possible that this is  a  real  phenomena  but  not  visible
because  of  the  "hard-core" nature of the population.  The
population consisted of people who constantly use computers,
not  all  are programmers (there was one television producer
for example).  The majority of people felt they had  started
using  computer  mail, and had become addicted from use in a
work setting.  It is foreseeable that the increase of office
automation  technology  will  create  more addicts no longer
willing to put up with the slowness  of  traditional  media.
Many  subjects  referred  to postal mail as "Snail Mail", or
remarked that computer mail freed  them  from  the  game  of
"Telephone Tag".

Below is an explanation of a modification made to the
database which caused the slot hangs yesterday.  (I have
deleted the dump files which were stored in SLOTDUMP:36.)


             ss
FAE had a collision pointer of 3F79, which belongs to
ACS.B/LOUVIERE (ACS.B/LOUVIERE's id. actually hashes out
to FAE).

When the 'dead' user's id. was addressed using a debug
command, the address 3F7A in file user was given (an empty
block).  The mistake was made when the 3F79 collision
pointer (to ACS.B/LOUVIERE's profile) was changed to
3F7A in block FAE.  This created a loop with address FAE 
pointing to 3F7A and 3F7A pointing back to FAE.

Disaster struck when ACS.B/LOUVIERE attempted to log in.  
Since this id. hashed out to FAE, and the user stored at
FAE was not B/LOUVIERE; the collision pointer was looked
up (37FA), which pointed back to FAE.  Thus, the system
went in an infinite loop back and forth between the two
addresses.

The collision pointers were relinked and all is in order.

                   SETTING UP ONTYME ACCOUNTS
               **********************************
 
During the past several months, OnTyme Administration has been 
bombarded with new accounts being validated without proper 
control.  Not only does this affect the charge back of OnTyme 
service difficult, but duplicate accounts and previously used 
accounts are being set up.  In order to resolve the financial 
issue, Service Billing has indicated that if accounts are not set 
up within the agreed guidelines, they will remove the account 
without notice.  
 
We ask that those users with the level of authorization to set up 
accounts refrain from doing so.  Instead, a worksheet must be 
generated and the account validation procedure must occur from 
the Validation`s Department.*
 
To generate a worksheet, please type :EXEC *** ONTYME.WORKSHEET, 
answering the prompts.  A department or charge center must be 
included somewhere on the worksheet.  The worksheet will forward 
automatically when complete, to OnTyme Administration, where 
processing will take place.  If the account is urgently needed, 
we will comply by contacting the appropriate individuals involved 
in this procedure and ensuring the account is set up as soon as 
possible.
 




 
                                                                Page  2

We thank you for your cooperation and remind you of the
implications behind setting up an account without proper
authorization.

Note :  The account, SUP, has been cleared by Service Billing as 
an account essential to bringing up an OnTyme host.  It is not 
necessary to send a worksheet in for this account.  However, no 
userids should be set up (SUP.SUP should be the only ID valid.)

Subject: File Pointer Problem? -- FYI 

To:  NTD.ONTYME
From:  Jeannine Ortiz
Re:  File Pointer Problem? -- FYI

-----------------------------------------------------

     What I'm about to describe may or may not be
directly related to the file pointer problem, but
I thought I'd bring it to your attention just the
same.

     The CLASS account on host 515 lost files.  A
thorough scrutinization of "ofile" brought three
file chains with CLASS's file hash to light.  One
of the file chains, however, had a different addr.
for the top of chain.  The TIBs for these files were
still intact and the creation/access dates of these
files were 1982 and 1983.  CLASS updates their
directory fairly frequently, so one would not expect
to find files last accessed three to four years ago.

     I relinked this chain back to the account after 
patching the back pointers to the top of the ofile
chain on all the blocks (each pointed to address 39)
and manually deleted them to free the TIBs.

     CLASS has been on 515 since January of '84 (they
were on host 2258 prior to that).  It appears as though
the old files were lost sometime in '84 and went 
unnoticed.  That makes sense; what doesn't (make sense),
is the top of chain pointer being 39 when it should be
1F0E.

     I don't recall any activity with this account in
the last two years which could be attributed to this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



The New Extended MAC Pascal Nucleus is ready for testing in our development
lab. This version only supports multi-meg slots. Testing of single meg slots
should use the production Pascal Nucleus.

The source is located at (SLLDCAIN:36)PNUC11.R12. A sample Slot TYM file is at
(SLLDCAIN:36)IN2105.T01. There are no changes to the TYM file.

Please use this new Nucleus with your current testing until a bug is
detected in the release.

This new Pascal Nucleus allows a process to use segments E and F for monitor
variables and stack space. This makes it possible to increase the current
OnTyme object code by 128K.

SUBJECT>   Our Migration to the MDEMS Account


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The following describes our migration to the MDEMS account :
 
DATE                      ACTIVITY
====    ========================================================
 
1/16    All users now a part of MDEMS have new IDS in MDEMS 
        account.* 
 
        To login to your new MDEMS ID, type the following :
 
        At please log in:  EMSMDEMS
        At ID? MDEMS.xxx   <----`xxx` is same as your old ID
        At KEY? WELCOME_TO_MDEMS
 
        <"_" reflects spaces in your key.>
 
        Please change your KEY as soon as possible for security 
        precautions.  (We validated the long key in hopes you 
        would change it quickly!)  Read *** ONTYME21.NEWS for 
        details of the necessary format.
 
1/17    Announcement to `World` of our new account, MDEMS.  Users 
        will be instructed to begin sending to your new MDEMS IDS 
        on Monday, 1-28.
 
1/21    Begin using new MDEMS IDS to send your messages.  Login 
        to your 'old' ID and check for incoming messages.  
 
        Transfer any files you wished SAVED to your new MDEMS 
        userid.  ( SEE NOTES BELOW PLEASE )  It can be 
        accomplished by the following :
 
                                                                Page  2

        1- Login to `old` ID.
        2- :GET * filename
        3- :SEND MDEMS.xxx   <---- your new ID
        4- Logout of 'old' ID.
        5- Login to new MDEMS ID.
        6- :GET MSG#         
        7- :FILE * filename
 
1/17    If there are any SHARED (**) files in the accounts, ACS, 
thru    FTCC or NTD which need to be incorporated into the MDEMS 
1/28    shared directory, please let me know.  The LAST day to 
        submit a request to transfer shared files is 1/28. 
 
1/31    Your `old` ID is removed.
 
                    * * *   N O T E S   * * *
 
        Use a hard copy of your session when transferring your 
files.  It'll make it that much easier when you file the messages 
away.  
 
        Make sure you file away your messages by 1-31, as your 
'old' ID will be cancelled (which removes all messages sent!)

 
* THE NEW MDEMS ACCOUNT INCLUDES ALL OF FTCC, ONTYME MARKETING 
(formerly of ACS), and ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly of NTD).  
 
 
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me 
via OnTyme (MDEMS.L/METOUR) or phone 408 446-7588.
 
Cheers to the success '86 will bring to MDEMS!!

                   A N N O U N C E M E N T !!
 
                       PLEASE TAKE NOTE...
                               
ONTYME MARKETING (formerly in ACS), ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly 
in NTD), and FRENCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (formerly FTCC) 
have folded into the new McDonnell-Douglas Company, Electronic 
Messaging Systems, MDEMS.  All users in the aforementioned 
accounts will now become part of the new OnTyme account, MDEMS.
 
Monday, January 28 is the date to remember.  Starting then, you 
must send OnTymes to the new account, MDEMS.  Any distribution 
lists which contain those users migrating to MDEMS should be 
modified to reflect the new account code as well.  
 
Both accounts, ACS and NTD will remain -- but the users now a 
part of MDEMS will no longer be valid in the 'old' accounts.  
FTCC will completely fold into the MDEMS account, so it will be 
removed in its entirety.
 
For simplicity sake, I have provided a list of those individuals 
who WERE NOT in the FTCC account.  (Just remember that all of 
FTCC will be MDEMS).  A complete directory can be pulled at your 
convenience, *** DIRECT.MDEMS.
 
Thanking you in advance for paying special attention to this 
announcement - we look forward to working with you in `86.
 
Should you have any questions or concerns, please address them to 
MDEMS.ONTYME or MDEMS.L/METOUR.

                       PLEASE TAKE NOTE...
                               
ONTYME MARKETING (formerly in ACS), ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly 
in NTD), and FRENCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (formerly FTCC) 
have folded into the new McDonnell-Douglas Company, Electronic 
Messaging Systems, MDEMS.  All users in the aforementioned 
accounts will now become part of the new OnTyme account, MDEMS.
 
Monday, January 28 is the date to remember.  Starting then, you 
must send OnTymes to the new account, MDEMS.  Any distribution 
lists which contain those users migrating to MDEMS should be 
modified to reflect the new account code as well.  
 
Both accounts, ACS and NTD will remain -- but the users now a 
part of MDEMS will no longer be valid in the 'old' accounts.  
FTCC will completely fold into the MDEMS account, so it will be 
removed in its entirety.
 
For simplicity sake, I have provided a list of those individuals 
who WERE NOT in the FTCC account.  (Just remember that all of 
FTCC will be MDEMS).  A complete directory can be pulled at your 
convenience, *** DIRECT.MDEMS.
 
Thanking you in advance for paying special attention to this 
announcement - we look forward to working with you in `86.
 
Should you have any questions or concerns, please address them to 
MDEMS.ONTYME or MDEMS.L/METOUR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The current status of Host 515 is as follows.  Message restoration for
1/22, the last day to restore, is currently in progress.  No major
problems have occured and barring any unforseen hurdles, the restore
should be complete sometime this evening.  A request was made to set
a system banner notifying all users to resend any messages or re-add/modify
files after 0100(PST) 1/23.  I am taking the liberty to change the time
to 0000 GMT 1/23.  The reason being that the last daily journal run for
515 was run around 1710 PST 1/22 which captures data up to 2359 GMT 1/22.

All nodes remotely involved with this problem will not to be used until
we define the source of the problem.  Post-mortum investigation will
commence on Monday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I intend on sending a complete report covering the restore and
subsequent verification of that process later today.  Briefly,
after the restore process was complete, I loaded the slot and
shut it after it answered.  I performed random checks of
restored data, both files and messages.  Then performed
functional tests - editing, filing, messaging both local and external.
The host was answered after I was satisfied that we had a good
set of databases - a copy of these is in 1st b/u shelf.  Host answered
around 0430 1/25.  The error count below is current for 515 and is
a direct result of clean-up activity while the host was shut - more
detail about the clean-up later as well.

If there are any problems or questions regarding 515, call me at
home, but if possible, late in the afternoon.

Terry Donaher must submit a report, dealing with merit increases by the
end of this week.  In order to do this, he must have employee numbers
and next review dates for our OnTyme Systems personnel.  However,
Human Resources is in the midst of an audit this week, and will not
be able to provide this information until next week, which is too late.

So, if you are interested in getting a merit review this year, the 
following information MUST be supplied ASAP, or NO REVIEWS WILL BE
PROCESSED THIS YEAR!!!

SUBJECT>   515 Problem Investigation


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Current Status of Host 515 :

   After the host was brought up and interrogated, the message and
file back-up journals were run.  This procedure almost always sifts
out any unsurfaced problem with either data structure.  There was
only one file TIB collision and no message anomalies.  That in itself
is a very good sign of the validity of the restore work.  In my previous
status of 515, I mentioned quasi clean-up causing the abnormally
high system error counts.  The counts were a result of both the
system running while in a shut state, causing the interontyme errors
and cleaning up the quasi in and in-old lists which were partially
restored.  The restore code lacks some code to completely restore
quasi message lists, however, this is not desireable.  The journal
snaps the system at a single point in time.  This does not prevent
the messages from being sent to other systems, therefore, the
message in the quasi lists at the time of the journal are already at
the destination host and should not be restored to the quasi lists
at restore time as not to duplicate messages in target hosts.

   Problem determination has not identified anything yet.  Holmberg disk
utility is currently running on suspect drive 1.  No other data is
available at this time.

Respectfully,

Gary Barlow

ken, this is what i have currently, complete as it may be.



                     OPERATIONAL ACCOUNT MOVE PROCEDURE


                                 EVENT LIST





     1.0  

     Two week warning


     Inform users not to send mail to external accounts.  In  addition  the
     external accounts, where there exists a quasi for the old account, are
     informed not to send mail to the specified account.  The elapsed  time
     of  this  operation  is  dependant  on  the  time it takes to create a
     message to send.  The goal is to have empty quasi lists.





     2.0  

     Mask quasies - 15 minutes per host


     The quasi accounts on the old system, as well as the quasis on the new
     host  and neighboring hosts are masked to allow new quasis to be added
     once the physical move is complete.


     To mask a quasi requires these actions to be taken :

     1.  find and dump quasi profile on each host

     2.  patch the quasi profile with a new name - this is a debug  command
         :DEBUg patch.

     3.  Remove original quasi name from the **** host file  of  each  host
         NOTE :  The **** directory contains only interontyme host files






     3.0  

     Block account


     The account on the host is blocked to prevent  use  by  the  account's
                                                                     Page 2


     users.  This is done by using an init file to inform users the account
     is being moved, logs out active users,  and  prevents  log  in.   This
     takes 1 minute to complete.





     4.0  

     Validate


     Marketing validates an account name on the old host to  represent  the
     old  account for renaming, which is done later.  Validate is a program
     that creates an account name that doesn't already exist.  The  longest
     recorded time for this step is 36 hours.  The speed of this program is
     dependant upon the network status.


     The account's network logon is rehomed to the new host.  20 minutes.





     5.0  

     Journaling


     The files of the account to be moved are journaled.  The time it takes
     for this task is dependant upon the quantity of files for that account
     and the quantity of characters per file.  Average time is an hour.


     Take target host down and download the  single  meg  restore  program.
     This  is  about  30 minutes.  The restore program is the only software
     that reads the tape containing the previously journaled files.





     6.0  

     Move the account


     The account is validated on the new host.  This takes 5 minutes 
                                                                     Page 3


     7.0  

     Restore


     The tape is mounted on the new host  to  restore  all  the  previously
     journaled  files  for  the  new  account.   Again,  dependant upon the
     quantity and size of files, this averages an hour.





     8.0  

     Physical move is complete


     As soon as the new host is up, marketing is notified that the move  is
     complete.





     9.0  

     Rename


     If any aliases for that account exist on the old host, then they  need
     to be deleted.


     The account is renamed on the old host.  An exec file is  created  for
     that  account  to  rename  all the users of the account as well as the
     account itself.  **** shared files, acc.sup, and account  profile  are
     renamed  using  a  name  that  was previously validated.  This step is
     optional and is usually not done for large  accounts.   To  allow  the
     users  access  to  the  old  account,  validations  must  home the old
     account's (that has a different name) network logon to the  old  host.
     Since  the  acc.sup for the original account still exists on the host,
     users will not gain access until this acc.sup is removed.   This  will
     allow the newly-named-original-account-on-the-old-host's users to keep
     the same password on logon.


                                                                     Page 4


     10.0  

     Cleanup


     Two weeks after the move has taken place,  the  quasi  lists  for  the
     original  account are checked.  If they are empty, the user profile is
     zerod out without disturbing the collision pointer.  The  pointers  in
     the top list/ofile blocks are also cleared.


     The account's messages are purged;  Marketing deletes the account.

               *** OnTyme/Outdial Pre-Meeting Agenda ***



1.  Osiris 21.05 - the following fixes have been implemented:

     a)  UP fix
     b)  TYPE fix
     c)  Ofile - multiple access
     d)  Journal - tape trailer
     e)  Alias Add crash fix
     f)  shared file acct. removal
     g)  multiple access - multiple messages
     h)  ALL MESSAGES READ trailer

     Items c, d, and g are currently being tested; all others
     have been tested.

2.  Status of version 22?

3.  Status of RESTORE - Lois is working on the new workspace code.
    OTS is in the process of turning RESTORE over to the QA department
    for regression testing.  The next release will be passed through
    the QA department for a complete overhaul.

New Items for Discussion:

4.  What progress has been made with respect to testing plans by
    QA for RMI (Reliable Machine Interface)?  QA received documentation
    last week and is currently reviewing it.

5.  515's Fiasco - the cause is under investigation.

6.  Nucleus related slot crashes - Operations has been informed that
    the Nucleus group (Martin Shen) has been given new priorities of
    which OnTyme pulls no rank.  There are numerous crash type 11,
    14, and several type 37 and 10 which have not been investigated.
    Operations would like to request Dick Gunther to take an upperhand
    in this dilemma and work towards a higher priority for the nucleus
    with respect to OnTyme (Michael Stimac should be notified).

7.  Recovery procedures for "host" 2859 - Operations would like to
    adapt host 2859 to the existing production system procedures for
    recovery.

 Items Pending:

*  Multi-site policy and strategy statement - currently in Phase II
*  Guildelines for three digit host prefix
*  Expanded Outdial capacity

Subject: seamlessness in print 

To wit:

What do we mean when we say that we want the ACCOUNT_MOVE process to be
"seamless"?  Consider the following observations.

    o   There should never be any limitation on any user's ability to send
        mail to any other user (except as might be expected in the course
        of normal operations, and the move itself).

    o   No mail to or from a moved user should be lost or duplicated.

    o   All files associated with the moved accounts and users should be
        moved, and their order in individual directories preserved.  As
        well, the creation and access timestamps should be the same as on
        the FROM system.

    o   All message lists should be moved and the order of messages on
        these lists preserved.

    o   Each message sent on the FROM system must bear the system prefix of
        that system in its message number field.  This avoids the collision
        of message numbers of the FROM system with those on the TO system.
        Messages sent on the TO system and received on the FROM system
        should have their message identifiers converted to the local format
        when they are moved.

    o   Delivery of InterOntyme messages to a moved user will appear to
        take longer than it would have for an unmoved account; but this
        phenomenon will only be experienced during the period in which the
        InterOntyme network is reconfiguring itself.

    o   A moved user should be able to address exactly those people s/he
        could address before the move.  This means that quasis must be
        created on the TO system for every account outside the moved
        account on the FROM system, and that copies must be made on the TO
        system of each quasi on the FROM system.

    o   Aliases die hideous deaths throughout the InterOntyme network.
        Users having aliases which rely on the moved account living on the
        same system as another are the particular victims.  It is well
        known Ontyme folklore that for "X.Y/Z" to be an alias for "A.B/C",
        accounts X and A must live on the same host.  Moving X or A breaks
        this special realtionship, and there is no way of fixing the
        damage, short of asking everyone to review their aliases after the
        move has taken place.

    o   RESTORE (the program) should be able to read and restore to the TO
        system information journaled when the moved account was still on
        the FROM system.  When the move involves an inter-site transfer,
        copies of all journal tapes in existence for the FROM system may
        be required to accompany the medium containing the new account
        ins:  The
        procedure looks as bit like this:

            o   A checkpoint of the FROM system is dumped to tape before
                the ACCTMOVE command is given there.  These tapes, along
                with copies of all availible journal tapes are sent to the
                TO site.

            o   Right after the checkpoint takes place on the FROM system,
                the ACCTMOVE command is given.

            o   When the tapes arrive at the TO site, they are mapped to a
                clean disk and the account-mover conversion software is
                used to move the account to the TO system's disk.

            o   The TO system is brought up and the network reconfiguration
                proceeds.

            o   The original account information on the FROM system which
                might have been deleted by the conversion program must be
                deleted by hand or by an additional new command
                (DELETE_MOVED_ACCOUNT).

        The impact of this on the user community is that the moved
        account's users are down for a significant amount of time (at least
        2 days), and tghose trying to contact these users will see this
        delay as a postponement of response.  This may or may not be
        tolerable to them, depending on the situation.

Subject: "Gary, The recently developed crash"... 

Gary,

The recently developed crash report form which ipc.support is using
to transmit information about ontyme crashes does not have fields
for the date and time of the crash.  Without this information, it
is impossible to determine the length of time the engine was unavailable,
and hence, it is difficult to assess our reliability and availability
to customers. 

Although some operators do include this information in their free-form
comments at the end of the report, we are finding more and more crash
reports without the date and time of the crash.  Please consider adding
this to the standard information reported after a crash.

Thanks,
Steve

Steve,

You were erroneously receiving Operations' copy to us regarding outages.
The exec we use to prompt for information that was created quite some
time ago indeed does provide the date of the crash.  At this point
in time, we see no real need to provide down and up times as this
information is not pertinemt to anomaly investigation.

Regards,

1.  Assigned to DEV - Osiris 21.05 - The last three of eight bug fixes
    are currently being tested.  These fixes are:  (1) "ofile" multiple-
    access, (2) journal trailer fix (to end the tape properly), and (3)
    multiple file access response messages.  Estimated release to QA is
    one week from today.  This release will be tested with the current
    version of Restore (2.01) for compatibility.

2.  Assigned to DEV - Osiris 22.00 - Subject line code is being merged
    in and the modules are being reviewed.  QA has received the RMI
    (Reliable Machine Interface) documentation and awaits DEV's testing
    scenario documentation.

3.  Assigned to DEV - Restore Software - Lois Lindley is working on the
    new workspace code (version 2.01).  OTS is in the process of turning
    Restore's QA over to the QA department for regression testing.  This
    next release will be passed through the QA department for a complete
    overhaul.



                                                                
    slot crashes a mystery.  Bill Bartlett will be arranging a meeting 
    with the appropriate personnel in efforts to achieve a higher
    priority for OnTyme-Nucleus related crashes.

6.  Assigned to OTS - Recovery Procedures for Host 2859 - Since 2859
    is not an ordinary test host, its recovery procedures will be the
    same as that for production systems.  The username OPER.STATUS
    will be added to 2859's OPER account to enable the LODSAV system
    monitoring utility to log in and check the host's status.  Host
    2859 will also be listed with the production hosts on the shift
    status report published by computer operations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     The status information contained in the pre-meeting agenda and minutes
     of the OnTyme/Outdial meeting of Wednesday 1/29 require correction.
 
     In a phone conversation between Bill Frickel and Glenn Ironhat during
     December, Glenn confirmed that he had received the External documents
     for the Reliable Machine Interface in September.  Although there have
     been corrections, the essential information in those documents is
     substantially unchanged since that time.  An updated copy of the RMI
     documents was sent to QA in December.
 
     We provided the documents as early as possible on the assumption that
     they would be used to develop test strategies in parallel with our
     development effort.
 
     We are confused by QA's request for test scenario information.  In the
     past, QA has maintained and we have agreed that QA testing should be
     independent from development testing.
 
     We will provide the testing tool, including documentation, that we
     developed and have been using to simulate a front end for the machine
     interface.  This tool can be used to submit test cases for RMI.
     However the actual test scenarios should be developed independently by
     QA to assure unbiased third-party testing.

     Following is a resend of a memo I sent in November regarding
immediate support.  Please cast this in stone as we cannot guarantee
100% support if this policy is not adhered to.  Thank you.

                           +++++++++

     "In efforts to ensure that we (OnTyme Support - Operations) are
reachable for a user (or system) problem necessitating immediate
attention, please note the following tip:

     Should an urgent problem arise during business hours and an
OnTyme Support person is not on the premises (of the data center),
Operations may be called at (415) 498-2588 and asked to page the
on-call for OnTyme Support."

                           +++++++++

     In addition to this the on-call can be reached at any hour
by requesting either Operations (x588) or Network Control (x5195)
to page the on-call for Ontyme Support.

                                                                Page  2

     If at any time you are unsatisfied with an Operator's analysis
of a problem you've reported, please feel free to demand that the
OnTyme Support on-call be paged.

Subject: "Gary, The time at which an OnTyme"... 

Gary,

The time at which an OnTyme node crashes,
the time at which the node returns to service,
the time the online pack copy begins and
the time the online pack copy ends 
are all very important pieces of information.

Although you are technically correct in that this information
does not aid us in our investigation of the immediate
problem, this information is crucial in a more global sense.

During the time a node is down, it is not available to our customers,
and during the pack copy, the system response is degraded.
Both our group and marketing need this statistical information to make an
informed analytical decision as to the severity of classes of problems
which we are experiencing.  This enables our three groups to set priorities
on various problems so that we address the most important issues first.

For a case in point, consider that it is not very effective to go to NTD and
say, "we've had a couple of nucleus problems -- please fix them."
We have a much better chance if we state something on the order of,
"54% of our downtime and 46% of our degraded time in the last six
weeks was due to nucleus problems.  This is our major problem
and we need your help to address it."

We have developed some tools which make it easy for us to put
this information into a data base and generate reports that will
provide us with summary information.  However, we can't do that
unless we have the data.  Alternatively, of course, operations could
track the data, but we are the group that is currently responsible
for generating status reports for the OnTyme systems.

Please reconsider the decision not to provide this data.

Thanks, 
Steve

                       PLEASE TAKE NOTE...
                               
ONTYME MARKETING (formerly in ACS), ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly 
in NTD), and FRENCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (formerly FTCC) 
have folded into the new McDonnell-Douglas Company, Electronic 
Messaging Systems, MDEMS.  All users in the aforementioned 
accounts are now part of the new OnTyme account, MDEMS.
 
Monday, January 27 is the date to remember.  Starting then, you 
must send OnTymes to the new account, MDEMS.  Any distribution 
lists which contain those users migrating to MDEMS should be 
modified to reflect the new account code as well.  
 
Both accounts, ACS and NTD will remain -- but the users now a 
part of MDEMS will no longer be valid in the 'old' accounts.  
Bear in mind though, if you are on a different host from either 
ACS or NTD, and you forget and send to an invalid userid, it 
will appear as if the message was sent.  Your host will only 
recognize that the ACCOUNT EXISTS. . .  
 
Later, in looking at your :OUT OLD list, you`ll notice that you 
now have the error message, INVALID USER next to the respective 
old userid.  It will therefore be necessary for you to resend 
your message to the correct new MDEMS userid.
 
Since the account FTCC completely folds into the MDEMS account, 
it will be removed in its entirety.  Appended below is list of 
those individuals who WERE NOT in the FTCC account.  (Just 
remember that all of FTCC will be MDEMS).  A complete directory 
can be pulled at your convenience, filed as *** DIRECT.MDEMS.

Subject: updated account move list 




                     OPERATIONAL ACCOUNT MOVE PROCEDURE


                                 EVENT LIST





     1.0  

     Two week warning


     Inform users not to send mail to external accounts.  In  addition  the
     external accounts, where there exists a quasi for the old account, are
     informed not to send mail to the specified account.  The elapsed  time
     of  this  operation  is  dependant  on  the  time it takes to create a
     message to send.  The goal is to have empty quasi lists.





     2.0  

     Mask quasies - 15 minutes per host


     The quasis, on the old  host,  representing  the  target  account  and
     quasies  on  outside hosts, are masked to enable new quasi profiles to
     be added once the move is complete.


     To mask a quasi requires these actions to be taken :

     1.  find and dump quasi profile on each host

     2.  patch the quasi profile with a new name - this is a debug  command
         :DEBUg patch.

     3.  Remove original quasi name from the **** host file  of  each  host
         NOTE  :   The  **** host directory contains only interontyme quasi
         names



                                                                     Page 2


     3.0  

     Block account


     The account on the host is blocked to prevent  use  by  the  account's
     users.  This is done by using an init file to inform users the account
     is being moved, logs out active users,  and  prevents  log  in.   This
     takes 1 minute to complete.





     4.0  

     Validate


     Marketing validates an account name on the old host to  represent  the
     old  account for renaming, which is done later.  Validate is a program
     that creates an account name that doesn't already exist.  The  longest
     recorded time for this step is 36 hours.  The speed of this program is
     dependant upon the network status.


     The account's network logon is rehomed to the new host.  20 minutes.





     5.0  

     Journaling


     The files of the account to be moved are journaled.  The time it takes
     for this task is dependant upon the quantity of files for that account
     and the quantity of characters per file.  Average time is an hour.


     Take target host down and download the  single  meg  restore  program.
     This  is  about  30 minutes.  The restore program is the only software
     that reads the tape containing the previously journaled files.


                                                                     Page 3


     6.0  

     Move the account


     Mount the daily tape from the FROM  system  on  the  TO  system.   The
     account  is  validated  on  the  new  host  using the daily tape.  The
     Restore program has  a  validation  command  that  adds  the  acc.sup,
     account  profile,  and  all  the users to the database.  The amount of
     time for this operation is dependant upon the size of the account.



     7.0  

     Restore


     The tape is mounted on the new host  to  restore  all  the  previously
     journaled  files  for  the  new  account.   Again,  dependant upon the
     quantity and size of files, this averages an hour.





     8.0  

     Physical move is complete


     As soon as the new host is up, marketing is notified that the move  is
     complete.





     9.0  

     Rename - This  step  is  optional  and  usually  not  done  for  large
     accounts.


     If any aliases for that account exist on the old host, then they  need
     to be deleted.


     The account is renamed on the old host.  An exec file is  created  for
     that  account  to  rename  all  the users of the account.  **** shared
     files, acc.sup, and account profile are renamed using a name that  was
     previously validated.  When the old account for the rename is manually
     validated, the account contains a sup.  The  sup's  files  and  former
     account's  shared directory is manually moved into the new sup and new
     account's directory.  To allow the users access to  the  old  account,
                                                                     Page 4


     validations  must  home  the old account's (that has a different name)
     network logon to the old host.  Since the  acc.sup  for  the  original
     account  still  exists  on  the host, users will not gain access until
     this    acc.sup    is    removed.      This     will     allow     the
     newly-named-original-account-on-the-old-host's  users to keep the same
     password on logon.





     10.0  

     Cleanup


     Two weeks after the move has taken place,  the  quasi  lists  for  the
     original  account are checked.  If they are empty, the user profile is
     zerod out without disturbing the collision pointer.  The  pointers  in
     the top list/ofile blocks are also cleared.


     The account's messages are purged;  Marketing deletes the account.

Gary,

Lois believes that she will be done with 21.05 testing by 1500 today,
so at that time, I will move version 22 testing from 4660 back to 2101.
Hence, I will not need 4660 once I can load 2101, so go ahead.

Thanks for the node,

SUBJECT>   Restoration of ACS Shared Files


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Well, we finally got stung from the inability to restore multiple
volumes.  A request from ACS was received today to restore all
shared files that were accidentally deleted by an ACS Support
user who was in the process of deleting an ACS user.  During the
preparation for the evening restore activity, I reviewed the output
of last weekends' weekly file back-up.  I found what I was looking
for, unfortunately; it took two volumes to complete the back-up.
I then had to decide to either go ahead with the restore or
cook up another plan.  The address of the USER profile block for ACS was
relatively small so I figured that all of the ACS shared files would
hopefully be on the first tape.  They did start a good way from the
end of the tape, however, there are some painfully large files in the
first 5 OFILE blocks for that account which, unfortunately, hogged all
of the rest of the first tape.  I wasn't given the number of files
that were deleted but being the ACS account, I'm sure that there are
a few hundred of them.  Ultimately, since neither the Osiris EOT nor
the restore correctly handles this situation, I had Operations bring
the host up without further restore action.  I could have pursued
a few other avenues, however, without sufficient information, I
didn't want to chance really messing things up.  There are currently
45 shared files in the ACS account.  I will have to gather more
information tomorrow and reschedule the restore for tomorrow evening.
Unfortunately, CSC is in the process of changing their exec that
provides our group with the necessary information and, therefore,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The updated copy of RMI documentation was sent to QA on JAN. 17th, not in
December as indicated.

QA has yet to be provided documentation on the use of the testing tool
developed for the testing of RMI.  It is not reasonable to expect QA to
develop test stategies.

The entire process of testing would be more efficient if all testing, both
INTEGRATION testing and REGRESSION testing was done by DEVELOPMENT where
it would be possible for the programmers to get immediate feedback and
problems would get immediate attention and the quickest resolution.

If it is desired that QA do its own testing then the testing tools that 
are developed must be made available to QA.

It would also be very helpful and timesaving if development would make
available to QA the test scenarios used during their testing phase
so that QA can analyze the extent of the testing already completed.

    Adele,

    I had a discussion with Virgil regarding dual-floppy PC-type machines,
    and his conclusion was emphatically that the AT&T machines on all
    comparable ranks are far superior to IBM's products (or any other
    lookalikes, for that matter).  This includes the dual-floppy box.

    For comparable money, the AT&T features 

                         Resulting in much faster performance:

        o   A real 8086, with 16-bit data path
        o   8 mhz clock


                              Necessary for serious use,
                          and usually requiring added boards:

        o   A full compliment of memory on the motherboard (640kb)
        o   A battery backed up time of day clock on the motherboard
        o   Serial and parallel ports on the motherboard


                                Added neatness:

        o   7 expansion slots (as opposed to IBM's 5)


    Virgil points out that the PC from IBM comes with a wimpy power supply
    which needs to be replaced if a hard disk is added and/or all 5
    expansion slots are utilized.  The 6300 has a 168 watt power supply
    capable of supporting all 7 slots and a hard disk.

    More importantly, he claims that the AT&T is cheaper to buy than the
    IBM box.  Both he and Steve Capik have looked at the engineering of the
    6300 and like it lots.  Steve owns one and loves it, Virgil wishes he
    owned one.

    I thought you might like to know this stuff, in case it ever became
    relevant.

Thanks for the info. and the reminder -- I've looked at the At&T (but not
recently).  Anyway, I was impressed.  And the screens are beautiful.  I'll
check out the prices with a few dealers.

Ken,   Bill sent me an Ontyme last night (can you beleive that). In it
       he mentioned that we are having a meeting with Stuart next
      Wednesday.   Ok fine...  he also said that  I am to have a {_list
        of projects based on account move documentation}i. To me thats not ok
        until all the loose ends ( quasis) have been identified and resolved.
        
       What do you think  ? (You may not care? )
       I'd  appreciate any thoughts you might have about loose ends that are not already in Cavins proposal ( even if they are is ok too)

       MY line is flaking out (my typing too)
talk to you soon

Subject: AT&T 6300: Another bit of hype 

    I discovered this after mailing the last entry, and thought it might
    merit inclusion in a sales presentation.  It seems that the video card
    which comes with the monochrome version is a color graphics card, kind
    of like what Compaq does, although it seems that Compaq's card is
    superior to the extent that they designed it to tolerate software
    dumping (text) to video ram willy-nilly, whereas virtually everyone
    else, including the 6300, sort of relies on the offending software
    following the proper horizontal and vertical retrace protocol.

REG: ACCOUNT MOVE SHORT TERM HIGH PAYOFF ENHANCEMENTS

1)   Ken should also attend this meeting as he is as knowledgeable as i am
     on account moves.

2)   Before i propose possible account moves fixes, everyone involved should
     agree on a standard account move procedure. I have spent a great deal of
     time working on an event list based on specific account move procedures
     (PMTS and FSC ACCOUNTS). 

     For evereyone to agree on the account move list, there should not be
     any loose ends ( i.e. a decision has to be made regarding the qausis,
     representing external accounts so that users of the account to be moved
     cannot havee their out list processed prior to a move. Of course, there
     are other alternatives which have to be considered which may be better
     for this item).

     In order to have decisions made on the "loose ends", they have to be 
     identified, this requires everyone's expertise and suggestions. As
     of this writing that i know of, the questions asked in cavin's
     document "account move proposal" still have to be answered.

3)   Any recommemdations that i may have cannot be made hastily to appease 
     any individual or group of individuals, they should be made with the
     group's ideas as input, as a first phase of development consisting 
     of a list of tasks, short term and long term, to form a basis for the 
     final solution ( the last development phase). This will save time 
      and money in the long run, and prevent the duplication of tasks to 
     achieve the same result.

4)   Any additions, thoughts,comments, complaints will be considered.

TO SUMMARIZE :  In order to suggest short term high payoff items,
     the following has to be done 

                  a) all "loose ends" have to be identified and decided upon.

                  b) everyone has to agree on a standard account move procedur

                  c) any work that is done has to be the foundation for the
                     whole project.

LASTly - I would appreciate it greatly if everyone reviewed my account move
           list and cavin's account move proposal.



                     OPERATIONAL ACCOUNT MOVE PROCEDURE


                                 EVENT LIST





     1.0  

     Two week warning


     Inform users not to send mail to external accounts.  In  addition  the
     external accounts, where there exists a quasi for the old account, are
     informed not to send mail to the specified account.  The elapsed  time
     of  this  operation  is  dependant  on  the  time it takes to create a
     message to send.  The goal is to have empty quasi lists.





     2.0  

     Mask quasies - 15 minutes per host


     The quasis, on the old  host,  representing  the  target  account  and
     quasies  on  outside hosts, are masked to enable new quasi profiles to
     be added once the move is complete.


     To mask a quasi requires these actions to be taken :

     1.  find and dump quasi profile on each host

     2.  patch the quasi profile with a new name - this is a debug  command
         :DEBUg patch.

     3.  Remove original quasi name from the **** host file  of  each  host
         NOTE  :   The  **** host directory contains only interontyme quasi
         names



                                                                     Page 2


     3.0  

     Block account


     The account on the host is blocked to prevent  use  by  the  account's
     users.  This is done by using an init file to inform users the account
     is being moved, logs out active users,  and  prevents  log  in.   This
     takes 1 minute to complete.





     4.0  

     Validate


     Marketing validates an account name on the old host to  represent  the
     old  account for renaming, which is done later.  Validate is a program
     that creates an account name that doesn't already exist.  The  longest
     recorded time for this step is 36 hours.  The speed of this program is
     dependant upon the network status.


     The account's network logon is rehomed to the new host.  20 minutes.





     5.0  

     Journaling


     The files of the account to be moved are journaled.  The time it takes
     for this task is dependant upon the quantity of files for that account
     and the quantity of characters per file.  Average time is an hour.


     Take target host down and download the  single  meg  restore  program.
     This  is  about  30 minutes.  The restore program is the only software
     that reads the tape containing the previously journaled files.


                                                                     Page 3


     6.0  

     Move the account


     Mount the daily tape from the FROM  system  on  the  TO  system.   The
     account  is  validated  on  the  new  host  using the daily tape.  The
     Restore program has  a  validation  command  that  adds  the  acc.sup,
     account  profile,  and  all  the users to the database.  The amount of
     time for this operation is dependant upon the size of the account.



     7.0  

     Restore


     The tape is mounted on the new host  to  restore  all  the  previously
     journaled  files  for  the  new  account.   Again,  dependant upon the
     quantity and size of files, this averages an hour.





     8.0  

     Physical move is complete


     As soon as the new host is up, marketing is notified that the move  is
     complete.





     9.0  

     Rename - This  step  is  optional  and  usually  not  done  for  large
     accounts.


     If any aliases for that account exist on the old host, then they  need
     to be deleted.


     The account is renamed on the old host.  An exec file is  created  for
     that  account  to  rename  all  the users of the account.  **** shared
     files, acc.sup, and account profile are renamed using a name that  was
     previously validated.  When the old account for the rename is manually
     validated, the account contains a sup.  The  sup's  files  and  former
     account's  shared directory is manually moved into the new sup and new
     account's directory.  To allow the users access to  the  old  account,
                                                                     Page 4


     validations  must  home  the old account's (that has a different name)
     network logon to the old host.  Since the  acc.sup  for  the  original
     account  still  exists  on  the host, users will not gain access until
     this    acc.sup    is    removed.      This     will     allow     the
     newly-named-original-account-on-the-old-host's  users to keep the same
     password on logon.





     10.0  

     Cleanup


     Two weeks after the move has taken place,  the  quasi  lists  for  the
     original  account are checked.  If they are empty, the user profile is
     zerod out without disturbing the collision pointer.  The  pointers  in
     the top list/ofile blocks are also cleared.


     The account's messages are purged;  Marketing deletes the account.

Re:  Ontyme support software status report  Jan 13 -- Feb 9  86

The first item on the report indicates a problem with 832 displaying
the incorrect nucleus version number occasionally.

This is NOT the reason that dumps were provided.  As indicated in the slot
crash report mail, there was a process which was looping in a GOTO
routine with no associated user logged on.  This was the reason for
the dumps and this problem still needs to be investigated.

Regarding the display of the incorrect nucleus version....  It was not
displayed occasionally but was diplayed consistently depending on 
which ontyme user port the user was logged onto.

Subject: "Abnormal" Slot Processes on Host 7150 

To:  Amy Lee (@Mdems.Support)
From:  Jeannine Ortiz
Re:  "Abnormal" Slot Processes on Host 7150

Since January 17th, there have not been more than 22
simultaneous users on host 7150 at any given time.
We have received reports of slow response time within
the last week on this host.  

Interrogation of the slot uncovered the following:


1.  CPU usage at 93% with a 7 user port load - this is 
    unusual considering the light user load and the fact
    that the disk activity was light.  When the slot is
    idling with a light user load, the CPU is usually
    in the 40-60% range.

2.  Processes 46-51 were in the following state (I also
    checked them while the slot was frozen):

    state=IO  priority=3 addr=28B3C in procedure ???

I do not know whether items 1 and 2 are related, but
would appreciate your investigating the second item
at your earliest convenience.  I am having the slot 
restarted at 8 pm tonight.  You are welcome to log 
into the slot (kernel host #2165) any time prior to
that if you'd like to poke around in the code.

The dump files are as follows:

INF     - (slotdump:36)d71501.043
LOADII  - (slotdump:36)h71501.043
NIB     - (jortiz:36)hs7150.n01

Thanks.

   LEGEND: DEV - MDEMS Development Group, SDI - Software Distribution
           and Installation, FSC - Field Service Company (h/w maintenance),    
           OTS - OnTyme Support (Computer Operations - IPC), HSS - Hardware   
           Systems Support, QA - Quality Assurance (Computer Operations - IPC)
           WNFE - Western Network Field Engineering, MKT - MDEMS Marketing  
           Support Group




1.  Assigned to DEV/QA - This pass of 21.05 was returned to DEV due to an
    increase in File Chain breaks.  A temporary fix - retry on the 1st
    error - increased the number of broken file pointers, therefore, the
    code was returned.  QA will continue on other, non-related areas of code.

2.  Assigned to DEV - Osiris 22.00 is in the DEV Integrated testing phase.
    The tentative release date to Betatest is mid March.  This code will
    contain a switch enabling the use of the new Subject Line List format
    on an account wide basis.

3.  Assigned to QA/DEV - Restore 2.01 - 2.01 will be released without the
    workspace changes.  2.02 will contain the multi-volume fix and
    3.0 will incorporate all of the workspace and MAT Chain additions.
    The QA group is reviewing 2.01 before its release.

4.  Assigned to MKT/NTD - Escalation of Nucleus crashes.  Martin is now
    reviewing some of the Nucleus crashes and has nothing to report at
    this time.  The new Nucleus being used by the DEV group for
    Osiris 22.00 will have to be "blessed" by the Languages Group prior
    its release.

5.  Assigned to DEV - Status of Inter-Ontyme move issue.  It was proposed
    that those involved with this project from the DEV group arrange to
    attend a "walk-thru" of a pseudo account move to resolve any mis-
    understandings of the move's time frame or procedures.  This should
    be coordinated between the DEV group and the Support group.



                                                                    Page 2



6.  Assigned to Support - New node billing.  Mat Russo  and Les Metour
    will be added to the GCF that is sent when new nodes are to be
    considered billable.  That is after the nodes have been burned in
    by Support and fully tested.  A report will be sent to MKT providing
    Support's best guess as to when the new engines will be considered
    billable.

7.  Assigned to MKT - Mat Russo is in charge of moving the DEV lab to
    Fremont.  No other status on this issue at this time.

8.  Assigned to Support/DEV - Possible Support of Holmberg (Disk Exerciser)
    code.  When and if the source code is located, the DEV group will
    determine whether they will be able to support the requested changes.
    The author or his cohorts will have to be contacted to locate it.

9.  Assigned to MKT - Discussion of the scope of the Product Control Board.
    A brief description of the PCB was presented but a complete description
    will be provided at the next meeting.  It deals mainly with discussion
    and prioritization of requests for changes or additions to the Ontyme
    product.

 Refer : MSG# A19405 from Glenn Ironhat
         regarding OnTyme Support status report


     1) Item 1 on OnTyme Support Software Status Report
        Jan 13 -- Feb 9 86 is not the problem Glenn was
        talking about in MSG#A19405.
        I was informed of the nucleus version problem in
        the MSG# A98734 sent by Glenn and no dump files
        were provided. And there were no dump files on 
        item one.

     2) The problem Glenn talked about in MSG# A19405
        was item 3 in the support report. This problem
        was reported in MSG#A00087 and MSG#A00965.
        The information and status of the problem is
        the above item in the support report.

     3) Since the incorrect nucleus version number was not
        displayed "occasionally" ( 'occasionally' was
        reported by Glenn in MSG# A98734.) but "consistently
        depending on which OnTyme user port the user was
        logged onto", providing this information when the 
        problem happens again would be necessary for debugging
        the problem.

     4) If there is any question about this, please Ontyme me.

Re : fixes


After talking with operations, it seems that our emphasis should be 
placed upon restoring external messages to the user outlists. That
is the bulk of their problems with the account move. The short terms
we thought of are in the right direction to make the procedure less
complex but the short terms we develop should answer their immediate
needs. 

1) Currently the restore program cannot restore external messages to the 
   account's user's out lists. This should be a fix that would involve
   alterating the message header record.

2) The capability of toggling Interontyme at the account level would greatly
   increase the ease of the account move by turning off IOT to allow the
   move to take place.
The above items should be ranked as the most important followed by our items
ranked as the most helpful.

3) NCB to reconstruct IOT connections
4) Limited access to old account
5) Removal of account and its messages and files

Subject: "In working on the documentation"... 

In working on the documentation for RESTORE, I did a comparison of the
commands in RESTORE and ONTYME.  Both use the command BUILD.  It is
used for building circuits in ONTYME, and for building system files in
RESTORE.

This seems to add an unnecessary layer of confusion on RESTORE.  I
suppose the RESTORE command is the one that should change since it
affects only the operations staff.  

Comments, suggestions welcome.  Changes in RESTORE would be in version
3.0 which will include updating the workspace operations.

1)  The slot dump files indicated in Item #3 of the status report belong
to Item #1 not Item #3.  This was indicated in the slot crash mail #A00965 sent
on Jan 15.  The slot crash report states that a dump was taken because of a
hung process.  It is stated that process #23 was looping in a GOTO routine.

Item # 3 in the support status report refers to process # 16 in a HALT
state.  Clearly this refers to a different problem.  The dump files of the
15th were taken while the system was up and running.  The problem described
as item #3 in the report, is a problem which caused the slot to crash.

Msg #A00965 is the crash report regarding the hung process #23 and the 
associated dump files H08321.015 and D08321.015.

Msg #A00087 refers to another software problem occurring the next
day.  In this case, there were no dump files provided.

2)  Message #A98734 reports the problem of the incorrect nucleus version 
number to the development group.  This was sent on Jan 13.  A follow up
ontyme #A01866 was sent on Jan 16.  This states that the incorrect nucleus
version number was displayed consistantly depending on the user port occupied.
This ontyme also reports process #23 looping in a GOTO routine.  This ontyme
also references the same slot dump file as indicated in the slot crash report
mail #A00965.

In actuality, the dump files are dumps of a hung process #23 AND dumps of the
system in a state where USER ports 5,7, and 8 reported the wrong nucleus
version number.

    tomorrow am, so look on my desk.  One document is velo-bound and should
    really remain that way, but the stuff in the envelope seems to be

1.  Assigned to DEV - When clearing files in a "folder.filename" the

    logon loop and "match" command bugs.  The pack copy fix has been

    compatible nucleus code).

3.  Assigned to DEV - Nucleus for Osiris 22.00 - Stuart has written some
    Nucleus code which is being used to test Osiris 22.00.  NTD's Languages
    Group must accept this code in order to officially release it.  This
    nucleus, however, currently supports only 4 aux circuits; OnTyme's
    current configuration requires at least 24 aux circuits to support
    InterOnTyme, Outdial and the NCB.

4.  Assigned to DEV - Multiple Volume Restore and Workspace Fixes - DEV
    is currently testing multiple volume code amidst a juggling of resources.
    As stands, DEV is developing a means to get around the end-of-tape
    milestone and an estimate for this code's release was not available.

5.  Assigned to DEV - Lower Authorization for EXEC Execution - The Army Corps
    of Engineers must grant their users an undesired authorization level of
    four to simply enable the use of exec menus.  Since this requires a
    small change to the OnTyme code, every OnTyme system will be set up
    likewise.  Since this may not be desired, DEV will investigate this
    matter and possible alternatives for MKT's review (it is a minor change,
    but the impact to other user communities must be analyzed).  This change
    might be incorporated into version 21.05.

6.  Assigned to OTS - Public Bulletin Announcement File - OTS will be
    creating a public file on all internal engines which will be set on
    each internal host as a system-wide banner indicating the filename(s)
    of public announcements.  This procedure will be introduced in a few
    weeks on a trial basis; rather than each account's supervisor sending
    the bulletins to all the account's users, MKT will use this banner to
    inform us of the latest bulletins.  MKT has proposed this effort to
    provide timely distribution of important bulletins.

7.  Assigned to QA - Nucleus Patch File - QA has written a patch file for
    the nucleus which will compute the cylinder, track and head for each
    disk error generated by the system.  This additional information will
    aid in the investigation of disk problems encountered on the test (backup)
    engines.  QA has submitted an NSR to NTD to include this patch.

Subject: Frustrated Online Pack Copy bug fix 


                  Does Ontyme really know its disk units?

I modified the Online Pack Copy command logic in UTLCMD.OSI to include a
test of the availabilty of both logical units.  This was in order to
prevent a pack copy operation from being initiated if one of the units
involved is not in READ/WRITE state.

The code I added mimicked the "DISPLAY VOLUME" command logic in performing
a "dsksys.disk_info()" call and checking the "options" field of each unit
entry for a value of "1" (advertised to mean READ/WRITE status).

The tests I performed today, and the results I got were as follows:

    o   I logged into OSIRIS:815, userid SUP.SUP.

    o   I put unit D0 into READ ONLY state by flipping the switch on the
        disk drive unit itself.

    o   I issued the command :COPY D0 D1.  In response, the following was
        printed:

            COPY FROM UNIT 00000000 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
                  TO  UNIT 00000001 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
            TOTAL PAGES= 000C7236

        and the "SELECT" light on D0 flickered for one or two minutes,
        apparently as the unit was being read.  After this delay, the
        following was printed:

            DISK ERROR
            COPY ABORTED!!

        (I had anticipated that my error message "FROM UNIT NOT READY"
        would be displayed and the copy operation not even attempted.)

    o   I attempted to try to guess what I should say to get some status
        information, issuing a number of commands which did no disk
        writing, and then I issued the "LOGOUT" command.

        The response was 

            please log in:

        a sure sign that Ontyme had crashed.  Later investigation showed
        that the reason for the crash was "DataBase Offline-FAIL 99"

    o   After switching D0 back to READ/WRITE state, I executed the slot
        using the DDT "E" command and found the system up and happy.

    o   I logged in to :815 again as SUP.SUP and issued the "DISPLAY
        VOLUME" command.  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

    o   I then switched D0 into READ ONLY state and repeated the "DISPLAY
        VOLUME". The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

        Ten seconds or so later, I repeated the command, and received the
        response:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   DOWN
              1   0   RW


    o   After switching the drive back to READ/WRITE state, all succeeding
        "DISPLAY VOLUME" commands showed the unit to be DOWN.  Attempts to
        FILE large files did not cause the "SELECT" light on D0 to flicker.

        This seemed to indicate that once the nucleus has decided the unit
        is down, there is no way to change that state, short of
        re-executing the slot.


Right now, it seems that the only way to tell if a drive is "DOWN" is to
try to write to it.  That's ok, but it also seems that once a drive is
found to be "DOWN", it can never be returned to READ/WRITE status.

Note that the result of the "dsksys.disk_info()" call did not accurately
reflect the fact that the drive was in READ ONLY state.  My guess is that
either the nucleus does not really understand the disk controller in a
number of ways, or the disk controller is giving erroneous information..

THE "M" ACCOUNT IS ON HOST 515.  A QUASI (QUASI M) HAS BEEN
ADDED TO HOST 7153.  WHEN THE COMMAND "QUASI M" IS ENTERED,
THE ERROR MESSAGE "KEYWORD IS NOT RECOGNIZED--TRY AGAIN"
OUTPUTS.  THE ERROR MESSAGE AND FACT THAT THE QUASI CAN BE
DISPLAYED BY USING "QUASI ALL 515" INDICATES THAT "M" IS
TAKEN FOR PART OF A SYSTEM KEYWORD (WHICH ONE, I'M NOT
CERTAIN).

THE ACCOUNT ITSELF (ON 515) CAN BE DISPLAYED WITH THE DISPLAY
ACCOUNT COMMAND AND I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEM SENDING
A TEST MESSAGE TO "M.SUP", SO IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE KEYWORD
PROBLEM ONLY EXISTS WITH THE "QUASI M" COMMAND.

If you get in on time and wish to attend, there is a demo of an encryption
product in the training room today at 1:30.  (I'll be attending)  It may be
the same company as the one you attended before -- but I think there will
be more opportunity for technical interaction.  At least that's what I
know so far -- information sketchy.  At any rate, I'll see you then if you
can come, else afterwards.

                     THE COMPETITION DISAPPEARS, REORGANIZES
     
     Two significant  competition moves  occurred this month:  AT&T abandoned
     NET 1000, and GTE SPRINT and U.S. TELECOM merged in joint venture.
     
     "ACS always  knew AT&T  was not a significant threat," says ACS Business
     Development Manager  Nancy Browning.  "ACS always succeeded at what AT&T
     failed to  do--the Ford  and IDP  applications are  examples.  [Both are
     forthcoming Success  Stories.    See  the  "ACS  Publications"  column.]
     However, our  clients were originally impressed with AT&T's presence and
     backing.   They had a large `share of mind' in the marketplace, and with
     that, they had the client's ear."
     
     If you  have lost  business to AT&T, or if AT&T was close to any of your
     prospects, call them now.  Those clients need a new vendor.
     
     "The SPRINT  and U.S.  TELECOM situation  was primarily  driven  by  the
     desirable merger  of two  long distance  telephone units,"  says  Nancy.
     "However, TELENET and UNINET are part of the deal.  Tymnet predicts that
     TELENET/UNINET will  take advantage of significant economies of scale by
     disassembling their  respective `backbones' and migrating the traffic to
     the new SPRINT/U.S. TELECOM backbone."
     
     In the  meantime, reorganization  and confusion  should  present  strong
     short-term sales opportunities for McDonnell Douglas.  The competition's
     sales and  support activities  will probably be disrupted as people move
     around and try to figure out who they work for.
     
     "If you  are  speaking  with  a  client  or  prospect  who  uses  or  is
     considering TELENET  or UNINET,"  says Nancy,  "be sure to emphasize the
     risks inherent in working with an unstable organization and to highlight
     McDonnell Douglas' focus and commitment."
     
     
                            NEW ONTYME PRODUCT MANAGER
     
     Tom Olt  has been  named the OnTyme Product Manager for ACS.  Tom brings
     over 10  years of marketing experience to this position.  Most recently,
     he worked in the Strategic Marketing Development group.
     
     As product  manager, Tom  will be working with your local consultants on
     providing nonstandard  pricing  information,  and  he  will  act  as  an
     interface to  the MDC  legal department when contracts are written.  Tom

Subject: lvol nucleus bug? 

    Martin,

    Please help me.  I need to know what (if anything) is going wrong
    with my use of the nucleus with regard to determining the state of
    the logical disk volumes we are using in Ontyme.

    I recently added some code to the online pack copy logic in Ontyme
    to insure that both logical volumes involved in the transfre are
    in R/W state before allowing the copy operation to be initiated.
    The io call to the nucleus used was

        io(data, parm, lvol, 0);

    where

        parm.operation := lvol_info;

    and my tests of this indicated that the information returned in
    the "options" field of the information record did not accurately
    reflect the actual state of the drive in question. In particular,
    I switched the "from" drive into Read-Only state and found that my
    lvol_info request indicated that the drive was in R/W state.

    Enclosed is a copy of the memo I wrote after doing my tests,
    detailing what I did.  What I would like to know is how to
    reliably tell the state of the logical volumes without causing
    them to go into a state which cannot be changed without
    re-executing the slot.

    Thanks for your consideration,
    
    Ken Dawson (mdems.k/dawson),
    Ontyme Development
                   Does Ontyme really know its disk units?

        I modified the Online Pack Copy command logic in UTLCMD.OSI to
        include a test of the availabilty of both logical units.  This
        was in order to prevent a pack copy operation from being
        initiated if one of the units involved is not in READ/WRITE
        state.

        The code I added mimicked the "DISPLAY VOLUME" command logic
        in performing a "dsksys.disk_info()" call and checking the
        "options" field of each unit entry for a value of "1"
        (advertised to mean READ/WRITE status).

        The tests I performed today, and the results I got were as
        follows:

            o   I logged into OSIRIS:815, userid SUP.SUP.

            o   I put unit D0 into READ ONLY state by flipping the
                switch on the disk drive unit itself.

            o   I issued the command :COPY D0 D1.  In response, the
                following was printed:

            COPY FROM UNIT 00000000 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
                  TO  UNIT 00000001 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
            TOTAL PAGES= 000C7236

                and the "SELECT" light on D0 flickered for one or two
                minutes, appcipated that my error message "FROM UNIT
                NOT READY" would be displayed and the copy operation
                not even attempted.)

            o   I attempted to try to guess what I should say to get
                some status information, issuing a number of commands
                which did no disk writing, and then I issued the
                "LOGOUT" command.

                The response was 

            please log in:

                a sure sign that Ontyme had crashed.  Later
                investigation showed that the reason for the crash was
                "DataBase Offline-FAIL 99"

            o   After switching D0 back to READ/WRITE state, I
                executed the slot using the DDT "E" command and found
                the system up and happy.

            o   I logged in to :815 again as SUP.SUP and issued the
                "DISPLAY VOLUME" command.  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

            o   I then switched D0 into READ ONLY state and repeatedME".  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

                Ten seconds or so later, I repeated the command, and
                received the response:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   DOWN
              1   0   RW


            o   After switching the drive back to READ/WRITE state,
                all succeeding "DISPLAY VOLUME" commands showed the
                unit to be DOWN.  Attempts to FILE large files did not
                cause the "SELECT" light on D0 to flicker.

                This seemed to indicate that once the nucleus has
                decided the unit is down, there is no way to change
                that state, short of re-executing the slot.


        Right now, it seems that the only way to tell if a drive is
        "DOWN" is to try to write to it.  That's ok, but it also seems
        that once a drive is found to be "DOWN", it can never be
        returned to READ/WRITE status.

        Note that the result of the "dsksys.disk_info()" call did not
        accurately reflect the fact that the drive was in READ ONLY
        state.  My guess is that either the nucleus does not really
        understand the disk controller in a number of ways, or the
        disk controller is giving erroneous information.

Subject: Proposed Memo re: soft error counts 


    Adele,
    
    This is a copy of what I intend to send.  I think it sounds better
    than it did.  The distribution list is ANEWMAN, FRICKEL, SLLDCAIN,
    IPC.GHB@Ontyme, MDEMS.B/BARTLETT@Ontyme.  Can you think of anyone
    else?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------


    Here is a proposal for a minor upgrade to the ONLINE PACK COPY
    command in Ontyme which would help avoid copy operations being
    initiated inadvertantly on systems with sick disk drives.

    We would essentially add a step to the operator's procedure for
    the pack copy operation, in which Ontyme would display the number
    of soft disk errors which have occured on each drive since the
    last system initialization or the last pack copy (whichever is
    more recent), and require the operator to answer a question like:

        DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE?

    Making the process of confirming the intent to proceed deliberate
    will provide a means of backing out of the command, either in
    consideration of this error count information, or for other
    reasons (such as the mistaken specification of the source and
    destination devices).

    Please consider this and let us know if you agreee with the
    sentiment, and what version (if any) we might include it in.

Ken,
   Distributed Systems Company had been part of Computer Systems Company.
DSC was the group which distributed PC's and related equipment to other
business units (presumably to sell to customers).  They were also involved
with service contracts.
   There was a bulletin earlier in March (I have a copy) indicating a
restructuring of DSC.  The Commerical Distribution Systems (whatever that is)
was moved to Diversified Information Systems Company.  The Retail Systems
business was assigned to ISG Marketing and Planning.
