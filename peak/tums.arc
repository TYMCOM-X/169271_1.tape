    (23 hours)  Equipment down - system :36

        Time spent trying to discover where space disappeared to on
        :36 this month, and where new space might be found.  This
        involved a significant amount of moving stuff to other
        systems, as well as performing disk usage investigations.

        NOTE:  The information moved to other systems logically
        belongs on 36, and should another 32000 pages magically show
        up tomorrow, this stuff would probably be shipped back.

Goals for Next Month

    Code and test pack copy command modifications in v21.07:  (1) use
    combined LVOL and DISK status calls to determine disk drive
    availibility, (2) display soft-error count since last system
    initialization or last pack copy and (3) require confirmation to
    proceed, thereby perhaps avoiding disasters.

    Continue working on the conversion software for translating V22.00
    databases to V21.06 formats.

    April 1st is my first day of class at Santa Clara University.

        (BETATEST)              Versions 21.07, 22.00, 22.01

    Thanks for bearing with us.
