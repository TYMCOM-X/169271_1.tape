                               CALCOMP DISK DRIVES
                               -------------------

I. DESCRIPTION:

   THE MODEL 215 DISK DRIVE IS A HIGH SPEED, RANDOM ACCESS, MEMORY DEVICE
   DESIGNED FOR MASS DATA STORAGE.
   THE UNIT COMPRISES TWO COMPLETE AND INDEPENDENT DISK DRIVES IN A 
   SINGLE CABINET. THE UPPER PORTION OF THE CABINET CONTAINS POWER SUPPLIES
   POWER DISTRIBUTION CIRCUITS, AND CONTROLS FOR TWO DISK DRIVES. THE LOWER 
   PORTION OF THE CABINET CONTAINS TWO DRAWER MOUNTED DISK DRIVES UTILIZING
   REMOVABLE DISK PACKS (IBM 2316, OR EQUIVALENT).

   EACH DRAWER CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE FRONT FOR DISK PACK INSTALLATION OR
   TO THE REAR FOR MAINTENANCE.

II.   OPERATING CONTROLS AND INDICATORS

   THE DISK DRIVES OPERATES UNDER COMPLETE CONTROL OF A DISK DRIVE
   CONTROLLER. HOWEVER, OPERATING CONTROLS AND INDICATORS ARE PROVIDED
   TO MANUALLY POWER UP THE UNIT, TO INDICATE UNIT STATUS, AND TO
   POWER DOWN THE UNIT FOR DISK PACK CHANGES OR MAINTENANCE.

   EXECPT FOR THE AC POWER SWITCH (LOCATED ON THE POWER DISTRIBUTION
   PANEL), CONTROLS AND INDICATORS ARE LOCATED AT THE UPPER FRONT OF THE
   DISK DRIVE. CONTROLS AND INDICATORS DIFFER FOR STANDARD AND OEM DISK
   DRIVES.

A.   CONTROLS AND INDICATORS FOR STANDARD DISK DRIVES ARE LISTED BELOW.

III. DISK PACK HANDLING

   INSTALLING DISK PACKS

   THE DISK PACK IS STORED IN A CLEAR PLASTIC , DUSTPROOF CASE COMPRISING
   A TOP COVER AND HANDLE, AND A BOTTOM COVER. TO INSTALL THE DISK PACK
   PROCEDURES AS FOLLOWS:

              A. OPEN DISK PACK DRAWER
              B. REMOVE THE BOTTOM COVER FROM DISK PACK
              C. CAREFULLY LOWER DISK PACK ONTO DISK DRIVE SPINDLE.
              D. ROTATE TOP COVER HANDLE CLOCKWISE TO LOCK DISK PACK ON
                 SPINDLE AND DISENGAGE COVER; LIFT AND REMOVE COVER.
              E. PLACE TOP AND BOTTOM COVERS TOGETHER TO PREVENT DUST
                 ACCUMULATION IN THE CASE.
              F. CLOSE DRAWER.

   REMOVING DISK PACK

   NOTE: DO NOT OPEN DISK PACK ACCESS DRAWER UNTIL DISK PACK HAS STOPPED
         ROTATING.

              A. SET ON/OFF SWITCH TO OFF POSITION. DISK PACK WILL STOP
                 ROTATING IN APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS.
              B. OPEN DISK PACK ACCESS DRAWER.
              C. CAREFULLY PLACE TOP COVER OVER DISK PACK.
              D. ROTATE TOP COVER HANDLE COUNTERCLOCKWISE TO ENGAGE
                 LOCKING MECHANISM OF DISK PACK TO TOP COVER.
              E. WHEN LOCKING MECHANISM IS SECURE (MECHANISM "CLICKS" AS
                 COVER IS ROTATED), CAREFULLY REMOVE DISK PACK FROM DRIVE
                 SPINDLE.
              F. PLACE BOTTOM COVER UNDER DISK PACK AND TURN RETAINING
                 KNOB CLOCKWISE UNTIL SECURE.
              G. CLOSE DRAWER.


   DISK DRIVE OPERATION

   READYING DISK DRIVE FOR ON-LINE OPERATION

              A. INSTALL DISK PACK ON DRIVE SPINDLE AND CLOSE DRAWER.
              B. SET ON/OFF TOGGLE SWITCH TO ON. DISK DRIVE PERFORMS
                 INITIAL LOAD SEQUENCE.
              C. OBSERVE THAT THE GREEN "READY" INDICATOR LIGHTS.

   THE DISK DRIVE IS NOW FULLY UNDER CONTROL OF THE CONTROLLER. NO
   OPERATOR INTERVENTION IS REQUIRED UNLESS:

              A. A DISK PACK CHANGE IS REQUIRED
              B. THE SELECT LOCK INDICATOR TURNS ON, INDICATING THAT
                 A MALFUNCTION HAS OCCURRED.

   TO CLEAR A SELECT LOCK INDICATION, SET ON/OFF TOGGLE SWITCH TO OFF.
   THE DISK PACK STOPS ROTATING AND THE RED SELECT LOCK INDICATOR TURNS 
   OFF. IF THE SELECT LOCK REOCCURS AFTER RESTARTING
   THE DRIVE, MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED.

   TAKING DISK DRIVE OFF-LINE

              A. SET ON/OFF TOGGLE SWITCH TO OFF.

   NOTE: DO NOT OPEN DISK PACK ACCESS DRAWER UNTIL DISK PACK HAS STOPPED
        ROTATING.
              B. DISK DRIVE IS NOW OFF LINE AND POWERED DOWN.

 IV. GENERAL INFORMATION

       A. DISK PACKS

           1. NEVER MOUNT A DISK PACK ON A FILE DRIVE IF THE
              PACK HAS BEEN DROPPED OR SHOWS SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE.
              SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE FILE DRIVE CAN RESULT. CALL THE
              CUSTOMER ENGINEER RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SERVICE IF PACK
              DAMAGE IS SUSPECTED.

           2. ALWAYS BE SURE THAT TOP AND BOTTOM COVERS ARE TOGETHER
              (EVEN WHEN NOT CONTAINING THE DISK PACK.)

           3. ALWAYS STORE DISK PACKS FLAT, NOT ON EDGE.

           4. EACH PACK SHOULD REST ON A SHELF, NOT ON ANOTHER DISK
              PACK.


           5. STORE DISK PACKS IN A MACHINE ROOM ATMOSPHERE.
              (60 TO 90 F, 16 TO 32 C, 10 TO 80% HUMIDITY.)

           6. IF A DISK PACK MUST BE STORED IN A DIFFERENT ENVIROMENT,
              ALLOW TWO HOURS FOR ADJUSTMENT TO MACHINE ROOM ATMOSPHERE
              BEFORE USE.


       B. DISK PACK LABELING

           1. NEVER PUT LABELS ANYWHERE ON A DISK PACK EXCEPT INSIDE
              THE CENTER HUB. USE ONLY AN APPROVED DISK PACK LABEL
              (IBM P/N 2267763 OR EQUIVALENT).

           2. NEVER PUT LABELS ON THE SIDE OF THE DISK PACK TOP COVER.
              LABELS CAN COME OFF AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE FILE DRIVE.

           3. DO NOT USE A LEAD PENCIL OR ANY WRITING IMPLEMENT
              WHICH MAY PRODUCE A LOOSE RESIDUE. NEVER ERASE A LABEL
              ON THE PACK (THE OLD LABEL SHOULD BE REMOVED AND A NEW
              ONE APPLIED).

           4. NEVER PLACE LOOSE LABELS OR CARDS INSIDE THE PACK
              COVERS WHEN REMOVING THE PACK FROM THE DRIVE. 


       C. STOPPAGES

      IF PROBLEMS ARE ENCOUNTERED IN PROGRAMMED OPERATION OF THE DISK
      DRIVE, THE FOLLOWING CHECK LIST SHOULD BE USED:

           1. MODULE I.D. PLUGS (CORRECT I.D. PLUG SHOULD BE FULLY
              INSERTED IN THE RECEPTACLE OF EACH MODULE).

           2. THE DISK PACK (SHOULD BE MOUNTED AND THE MODULE DRAWER
              SECURELY LATCHED CLOSED).

           3. START STOP SWITCH (SHOULD BE ON AND AS A RESULT THE FILE
              SHOULD BE IN A READY CONDITION, GREEN LIGHT ON.)



      D. SELECT LOCKS (RED INDICATORS ON)

           IMPORTANT: SELECT LOCK INDICATIONS MAY BE RESET BY POWERING
           OFF THE DISK DRIVE AND THEN TURNING IT BACK ON. IF THE SELECT
           LOCK PERSISTS, THE DRIVE SHOULD BE SPARED AND NORMAL TROUBLE
           REPORTING PROCEDURES FOLLOWED:

      DISK I/O ERRORS

           1. VERIFY THE DISK PACK IS PROPERLY INITIALIZED AND HAS CORRECT
              VTOC.

           2. WHEN PERMANENT READ ERRORS OCCURVIDHE PACK SHOULD BE MOVED
              TO ANOTHER MODULE. DO NOT MOUNT ANOTHER PACK ON THE
              FAILING MODULE.

           3. NEVER MOVE A DISK PACK CAUSING ERRORS MORE THAN ONCE.
              CALL A CUSTOMER ENGINEER AND HAVE BOTH THE FILE DRIVES
              AND THE DISK PACK INSPECTED FOR DAMAGE IF ERRORS PERSIST.
              IF NO PERMANENT READ ERRORS ARE PRESENT WHEN THE PROGRAM
              IS RETIRED, THE MODULE THAT FAILED SHOULD BE SPARED AND
              NORMAL TROUBLE REPORTING PROCEDURES FOLLOWED.
