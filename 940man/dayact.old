INTRODUCTION
------------

        THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO CALL ALL THE PROGRAMS OR PROGRAM
CHAINS IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WHICH ARE IN THE FILE DIRECTORIES
OF (*4ACCT) AND (*4PROG).  IT ALSO WRITES OUT THEIR RESTART FILES.
1ACCOUNTING CAN ONLY BE USED BY A PERSON WITH DISTRICT STATUS OF
ZERO.

        EVERY EVENING, PRIOR TO TAKEDOWN, 1STORAGE, 1GASP AND 
1ACCOUNTING IS RUN (SEE 1STORAGE AND 1GASP DOCUMENTATION ELSEWHERE
IN THIS MANUAL).  THESE TWO PROGRAMS OUTPUT FILES WHICH MUST BE PRE-
SENT BEFORE 1ACCOUNTING CAN BE RUN.

        1ACCOUNTING OUTPUTS INFORMATION TO THE OPERATOR'S TTY PER-
TAINING TO BILLABLE TIME, TOTAL TIME, BILLABLE CPU, TOTAL CPU, AND
TOTAL LOGOUTS.

        THIS INFORMATION IS TO BE SAVED ON THE TTY PAPER AND PUT IN
THE APPRORPIATE FOLDER IN THE BATCH CONTROL AREA.
