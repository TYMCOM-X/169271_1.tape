To:        All Personnel VG1 & 2

Subject:   New Security Procedures


1.  On 28 October 1985, the following security procedures will be
    effective in VG1 and 2:

    a.  MDC ID Badges must be shown to the Security Guard /
        Receptionist for admittance to the buildings.

    b.  Wearing of the badge while in the building is optional but
        encouraged.

    c.  The only entrances/exits to the buildings are:  Lobby VG1,
        Lobby VG2 and the rear door by the mail room in VG1.  These
        entrances/exits will be manned by a Receptionist/Security
        Guard to check ID Badges and to control MDC property 
        removal.  The Lobby VG2 and the back door of VG1 will be
        opened 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, the lobby of VG1 
        will be opened from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM Monday thru Friday
        only.  All other doors will be locked from the outside and
        alarmed but can be used as emergency exits.

    
2.  A fence is planned for the rear of the court yard when this fence
    is built the doors that exit into the courtyard will be left
    unlocked during working hours for the convenience of the employees
    but until that time these doors will remain locked and alarmed.

3.  The above new security procedures are being taken to increase
    security to MDC employees and to stop the unauthorized removal 
    of MDC property .

4.  Your observance of these new security procedures will be appreciated.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 29 Oct 85



To:       ISG Employees Eligible for Benefits

Subject:  ISG OPTIONAL SPECIAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE PLAN



During the month of November 1985 eligible employees who are not 
now members may elect to enroll in the Optional Special Accident 
Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

    $ 25,000                 $ .23             $ .34
    $ 50,000                 $ .45             $ .68
    $ 75,000                 $ .68             $1.02
    $100,000                 $ .90             $1.36
    $125,000                 $1.13             $1.70
    $150,000                 $1.35             $2.04
    $175,000                 $1.58             $2.38
    $200,000                 $1.80             $2.72
    $225,000                 $2.03             $3.06
    $250,000                 $2.25             $3.40

If you elect family coverage, consult your Group Insurance 
Summary Plan Description for the definition of an eligible 
child.  The benefit payable depends on your family makeup:

     SPOUSE ONLY       SPOUSE & CHILDREN       CHILDREN ONLY

         60%             Spouse - 50%               20%
                          Child - 10%

Enrollment cards can be obtained from your local Human Resources 
Office serving your area.  Completed cards must be dated during 
the month of November 1985, and forwarded to your Human Resource 
Office no later than November 29, 1985.

OnTyme internal usage is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds!  
In fact, next Saturday, November 16, we`ll be bringing a FIFTH 
OnTyme host (2288) into our internal `communication network`.
 
Field Services Company, otherwise known as `FSC`, will be moving 
to the new host Saturday.  In order to initiate host-to-host 
communication immediately, we need your help:  
 
Please send any messages to FSC prior to Thursday, end of 
business day (1700 - PST).  This will ensure that all FSC users 
receive your messages.  Some of you may also use distribution 
lists that include FSC users.  The same assistance is needed here 
as well.  Use these lists prior to Thursday please.
 
You may resume communication at approximately 1500 (PST), Saturday.  
 
Just to recap:
 
                           **********
 
                       PLEASE DO NOT SEND 
                     MESSAGES TO FSC BETWEEN 
                   1700 (PST), THURSDAY, 11-14 
                               AND
                   1500 (PST), SATURDAY, 11-16
 
                           **********
 
That`ll do.  Your assistance is MOST appreciated.  Thank you in 
advance for your cooperation.

I  am  pleased  to  announce  the  formation  of  the Information
Systems  Group  Procurement  organizations  consisting of a Group
Procurement  Office  located  in  St.  Louis  and  three Regional
Material Support Centers effective immediately.

Donald  J.  (Don)  Boland  is  appointed Manager, ISG Procurement
reporting  to  the  writer.  Don has over 30 years of procurement
related  experience  with  MDC.    The  Information Systems Group
Procurement  office  is responsible for Information Systems Group
procurement  policy  and  standards  and for directing group wide
purchasing,  inventory  issues, equipment leasing and procurement
planning.   The Group Procurement staff of seven individuals will
obtain  economies  of  scale  through group wide consolidation of
requirements,  establishing  common  communications and equipment
transfers,  and  administering  and originating third party lease
arrangements.

The  Regional  Organizations were developed using the Information
Systems    Group/Regional   Organizations   Concept   which   has
management  acceptance.   These Regional Material Support Centers
will  report  to  "Host"  Business  Units  in St. Louis, Southern
California  and  Northern  California.    Each  Center will offer
procurement  services  to  ISG  businesses and functions in their
region  including their "Host" organizations.  Business Units can
provide their own procurement support if they choose.

Karen  Gedera  is  assigned  responsibility  for  the  St.  Louis
Regional  Material  Support  Center  reporting  to  Rich Calvert,
President   Diversified   Information  Systems  Company  (DISCO).

the  computer  industry  which includes the past eight years with
Microdata and ISG.

be  in  addition  to  his  responsibility  as Director, Financial
Control  for  NSCO.    Coy has over 30 years of Fiscal experience
with MDC.

The  Procurement  groups  have  reduced  staffs  significantly in
response  to  ISG's  performance improvement program.  In concert
with  ISG's  performance  improvement  program  and moratorium on
promotions,  these  organizations  are being put in place with no
increase in headcount and no promotions.

Information   Systems   Group  purchases  currently  exceed  $300
million  per year and represent a sustaining opportunity for cost
and  quality  optimization.    Don,  Bob, Coy and Karen and their
staffs  are  dedicated  to  obtaining maximum value for every ISG
purchase  dollar.    Please  give them your full support in their
efforts.

DATE:  30 January 1986

SUBJECT:  Property Removal System

TO:    MDC-ISG San Francisco Bay Area

From:  Ron Birdsong-Manager, Security Control


1.  There have been some questions directed to the Security
Department concerning the new property removal system
controlling property that is brought in or taken out of
MDC-ISG facilities.  The following should help clarify any
further questions that arise.

    a.  GENERAL

        (1)  Any items, excluding documents, viewgraphs and
             Automatic Data Processing products, handcarried
             from company premises which are not readily
             identified as personal property of the bearer,
             or are not being removed in accordance with an
             approved control procedure, (authorized for
             movement by a properly authenticated shipping
             document) must be accompanied by an authorized
             Property Removal Pass, or removal must
             be authorized by the Security Department.

        (2)  Authorizing property to be removed by the 
             CHARGE-OUT AND REMOVAL PASS or the
             CONTINUOUS REMOVAL PASS issued to an employee
             is the responsibility of management level
             personnel.

    b.  PROPERTY REMOVAL PASSES

        (1)  There are two types of passes which are utilized
             for property movement, they are the 
             CONTINUOUS REMOVAL PASS and the CHARGE-OUT AND
             REMOVAL PASS.  The primary purpose of the passes
             is to provide a means by which an employee may
             move property from one MDC-ISG location to another
             within the Bay area.  Removal of personal property
             of an employee, vendor or visitor, not readily
             identifiable as personal property, must be
             authorized by a AND REMOVAL PASS.
             Recognizable personal property of employees,
             visitors or vendors will not require a pass.

             (a)  Continuous Removal PASS

                  -  The Continuous Removal Pass will be issued to
                     an employee who has a frequent need to move
                     specific types of property or supplies from
                     one MDC-ISG building to another within the
                     Bay area.  (NOTE:  This pass does not
                     authorize removal of the property by the
                     bearer for personal use).

                  -  Request for Continuous Removal Passes should
                     be in writing directed to the Security
                     Department giving the name of the loyee neeeding to have a new Continuous
                     Removal reissued will have to submit a new
                     written request to the Security Department.

           (b)  Charge-Out and Removal Pass

                -  The Charge-Out and Removal Pass will be issued to
                   personnel for handcarried removal of specific 
                   items of company property, and/or for removing
                   personal proprty of employees, visitors and
                   vendors that cannot readily be identified as
                   personal popety.

                -  The pass will be filled out completely and signed
                    by management level personnel prior to the
                   employee handcarrying the property.

                -  A supply of the Charge-Out and Removal Passes can
                   be obtained from the Security Department by
                   management level personnel.

                -  Each receptionist and security officer has a
                   supply of these forms for use by visitors or vendors
                   only.  All employees needing a Charge-Out and 
                   Removal Pass should contact their management level
                   personnel.

                -  When describing the MDC-ISG property on this pass
                   it is very important to include any serial numbers
                   and/or ISG tag numbers.  Failure to do so will 
                   only slow down the removal of the property as the
                   security officer or receptionist will have to
                   complete the pass with this information.

2.  Your compliance with these procedures will be appreciated.

          ALL ISG EMPLOYEES


          CHANGE IN TAX LAWS - TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS





    McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (ISG) employees 
attending a college, university or other reimbursable program 
under the ISG Tuition Reimbursement benefit should be aware of a 
change in the tax law concerning tuition reimbursements.

    Code Section 127 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 
1978 and excluded tuition reimbursements from gross income.  This 
section of the Code expired on December 31, 1985 and unless a new 
Code amendment is passed or the present one extended, tuition 
reimbursements will be included in gross income and subject to tax 
withholdings beginning January 1, 1986.  As a result, tuition 
reimbursements paid to employees after January 1, 1986 will 
reflect the withholding of the appropriate amount as required by 
the law.

    There is an indication that Congress may act in early 1986 to 
reinstate the provisions of section 127.  If that occurs, ISG will 
make appropriate refunds to the affected employees.

DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, ENROLLMENT IN TYMNET TRAINING AND EDUCATION
COURSES FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 1986 IS NOT AS HIGH AS PROJECTED LAST OCTOBER.
THEREFORE, WE ARE MODIFYING THE SCHEDULE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER.  THIS
MODIFICATION PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

    A)  CLASS SIZE WILL BE LARGER WHICH MAKES TRAINING MORE EFFICIENT.
    B)  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CANCEL CLASSES.
    C)  TTE WILL BE ABLE TO DESIGN AND DELIVER MORE CUSTOMIZED COURSES
        FOR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS.
 
THE DISADVANTAGE OF THIS REVISION IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED
IN CLASSES THAT ARE NO LONGER ON THE SCHEDULE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE PLANS.
WE REGRET THIS INCONVIENCE AND WILL DO OUR BEST TO RESCHEDULE YOU FOR AN
ACCEPTABLE TIME.  CHERYL MCGOWAN, TTE REGISTRAR, WILL CONTACT YOU TO
RESCHEDULE.
 
***  SPECIAL NOTE TO SALES REPS - PLEASE INFORM YOUR CUSTOMERS OF THIS
     REVISIOIN.
 
THE PRINTED SCHEDULE AVAILABLE FROM SUSAN COPELAND WILL BE CHANGED BUT
THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS.  MOST CLASSES FOR WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE
CURRENTLY REGISTERED WERE NOT CHANGED.  PROPOSALS FOR CUSTOMER-SITE
CLASSES ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS REVISION. ***

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  dical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

Subject: Parking Lots at Valley Green 

DATE:      5 March 1986

TO:        All Employees

SUBJECT:   Parking Lots at Valley Green

From:      Ron Birdsong - Manager, Security Control


On Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 9 March 1986 the parking lots
at 20605 and 20705 Valley Green (VG1, VG2 and VG3) will be
resurfaced and striped.  Those employees needing access to
these facilities should park on the south side of VG2 and
the west side of VG1 and VG2 adjacent to the lobby entrance.
All employees entering VG1 and VG2 can do so through the
front lobby entrance.  This entrance will be open 24 hours
a day during this weekend as well as the lobby to VG3.
All employees should have their vehicles moved to the
appropriate spaces no later than 5:00 AM on 8 March 1986.
Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.
