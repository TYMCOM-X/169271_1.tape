                      ----- -- --- --------- ----

       ((INTRODUCTION))

            PROBE is the access  and  control  program  for  the  TYMNET
       supervisor.   It is a major subsystem which runs on the Interdata
       model 7/32.  The primary operator functions in PROBE are:

               1) to determine the general status of the network;

               2) to check on the status of individual nodes in the net
                  especially if it becomes necessary to reload a node
                  or move a host from one hardware to another;

               3) to establish a central logger terminal which can
                  extract information of interest to operations about
                  all the systems in an entire computer center.

            In addition, PROBE can be used to manipulate the  useage  of
       individual nodes and long lines, move the network supervisor from
       one Interdata to another, and perform other activities  vital  to
       the  maintenance  of TYMNET.  For the most part, these additional
       capabilities are within the  domain  of  TYMNET  NETWORK  CONTROL
       CENTER and require special status.  It is imperative that NETWORK
       CONTROL be involved as much as possible in  any  of  these  other
       procedures.

       ((COMMAND SUMMARY))

               1) LOGIN TO PROBE ON THE ACTIVE SUPERVISOR;

               2) NEXT ENTER THE NAME WCO AND THE CURRENT OPER PASSWORD;

               3) TYPE THE PROBE COMMAND 'STATUS';

                (A. NODE CHECKING - N IS A NODE NUMBER)
                ---------------------------------------

               A4) TYPE THE COMMAND 'HOST N' TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF
                   THAT HOST (EG. 'HOST 38')

               A5) TYPE 'NODE N' FOR ADDITIONAL INFO ON THAT NODE;

               A6) QUIT THE PROGRAM AND LOGOUT OF THE INTERDATA WITH
                   THE 'EXIT' COMMAND.

                   (B. FOR RUNNING A LOGGER TERMINAL)
                   ----------------------------------

               B4) TYPE THE COMMAND 'EXTRACT 700' FOR CUPA CHECKING
                   TYPE 'EXTRACT 701' FOR CUPC CHECKING.



                                STARTUP

            The first person to login to PROBE after the 7/32  has  been
       brought  up  will be asked to supply Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in
       the format DD:HH:MM where DD is the  number  of  days  since  the
       begining  of  the year.  When the TYMNET clock is installed, this
       function will normally be handled by the TYMNET clock.  By typing
       a  control Q here the program will skip the date input and prompt
       for login.


                                 LOGIN

            All Interdata supervisors will run  on  "host"  systems  120
       through 127.  The following are valid ways of getting into PROBE:

                       PROBE:127;(password);
                       PROBE:*;(password)cr

            The asterisk (*) refers to the currently active supervisor.


                                     NOTE

           One may end the PROBE password with a semicolon or
           carriage return, but not both.



            After the circuit has been built to the 7/32, PROBE will ask
       for an additional username.  You should use WCO as the username.
       After the name has been entered, PROBE will ask for the password.
       This password is the same for WCO as the login password for OPER
       on Tymshare hosts.


                              COMMAND MODE

            Whenever a colon appears on the left hand margin, PROBE is
       ready to accept another command.

            All PROBE commands must be typed out in full on one line and
       ended with a carriage return.

            To get back to PROBE command mode (after login has been
       completed) type a control Q or escape.  This will abort the
       current activity and return to command mode.



               COMMANDS WHICH INVOLVE GENERAL INFORMATION
               -------- ----- ------- ------- -----------


       HELP (or H, or ?)

       Refers user to the document file PROBE.DOC.

       SEND J MESSAGE 

       This sends a message to the user on job j.  Use the WHO command
       to find out the proper job label.

       SYS 

       Type out host, or system number.

       TIME 

       Type out the current time.

       WHO 

       The WHO command lists the current PROBE users and their job
       labels.  The joblabels are needed for the SEND and HANG commands.

       VERSION 

       Print out the version numbers of PROBE, the kernel, and the
       supervisor.

       EXIT

       This command quits the PROBE program and logs out of the
       INTERDATA 7/32.



              COMMANDS WHICH INVOLVE THE STATUS OF TYMNET
              -------- ----- ------- --- ------ -- ------

       STAT 

       This command prints out the numbers of nodes in each of the 5
       takeover states, the df (see below), and the reject count.  The
       reject count is the count of the number of times the supervisor
       could not build a circuit because of shut lines, lines out of
       channels, or nodes out of passthroughs.  The source and
       destination nodes of the last rejected login attempt are printed
       after the reject count.  If SUP is not running (neither awake nor
       asleep) the kernel's Status will appear at the end of the first
       line.  The kernel status may be interpreted as follows:

               NUMBER  MEANING
               ------  -------
        1000    FROZEN BY OPERATOR
         800    PARITY ERROR IN THE SUPERVISOR - OR JOE RINDE HAS
                STOPPED THE SUPERVISOR FOR EXAMINATION
         100    SUPERVISOR HAS FAILED TO RECOVER FROM A CRASH - THE
                SUPERVISOR CODE AREA HAS PROBABLY BEEN CLOBBERED.

       COUNT 

       This counts the number of nodes, terminations,  and  passthroughs
       in the net.  It does not count internal circuits as terminations.

       DF (NUMBER) (Requires Status 01)

       This is used to compute the drowsiness factor.  When a supervisor
       goes  to  sleep  or otherwise fails to send 'sleeping pills', the
       other supervisor systems will remain dormant for only the  number
       of  seconds  they  are  supposed  to remain asleep based on their
       ranking in the 'supervisor pecking order'.  The drowsiness factor
       is  a  number  that  is  factored into this.  1000 decimal is the
       largest number that one  may  enter.   This  has  the  effect  of
       suppressing the supervisor.

       AWAKE (Requires Status 01)

       This  command  will  awaken  the  supervisor  immediately.   This
       overrides all previous reasons for sleeping, including a large DF
       (Drowsiness Factor - how long the  supervisor  in  question  will
       remain dormant when an active supervisor goes to 'sleep'.

       SLEEP (Requires Status 01)

       Put the current active supervisor to sleep.

       LSHUT 

       List all the shut lines.



               COMMANDS WHICH INVOLVE THE STATUS OF NODES
               -------- ----- ------- --- ------ -- -----

       CT NODE 

       This command traces all circuits terminating at this  node.   All
       port numbers are in decimal.

       CP NODE 

       This traces all circuits passing through this node.

       CL NODE LINE 

       Use this to trace all circuits on this line.

       HOST 

       This command types information about a host  or  hosts.   If  for
       example,  you  type 'HOST 19' PROBE types info about host 19.  If
       you type 'HOST'(CR), the program types info about all hosts.  The
       info  typed  is  host  number,  down,  shut or answered, position
       number on its base, and base number.

       AN 

       This command will type out  node  number,  version  number,  host
       numbers  (if any), terminations (not counting internal circuits),
       passthroughs, crash count, upstream node number,  and  downstream
       node number for all nodes in the net.

       AD 

       This will list all down nodes including those nodes which are not
       in net, but are known by nodes which are in the net.

       EXC 

       List lines which are out or in some other exceptional state.

       N

       N is short for node.  see below.

       NODE NODE 

       This will give version number, crash count,  upstream  direction,
       downstream  direction,  and exceptional conditions for this node.
       This command will also provide the  number  of  passthroughs  and
       terminations.   If  the  node is a base it will give host numbers
       and status of each host.  Hosts will appear in order of  position
       on  base  (0  or  1).  neighbor number, number of groups, cost of
       using line, and exceptional conditions  for  each  line  will  be
       output.



       NEIGHBOR NODE 

       This will scan node descriptors of all nodes to  find  references
       to  the  specified  node.   Output from this command includes the
       node number, line number, and number of groups for  the  neighbor
       of the specified node.

       RETAKE NODE (Requires Status 20)

       This instructs the supervisor to retake the node.

       BORI node LINE (Requires Status 20)

       This tells a node to reset it's BORI header (Beginning Of  Record
       Input).

       ESHUT NODE NODE (Requires Status 10)

       This will make an entry to the supervisor's shut line table.  The
       effect is to shut the line between the specified nodes.  This can
       also be done by using the 1DOWN program.

       RSHUT NODE NODE (Requires Status 10)

       Use this command to remove a shut between these two nodes.

       CLEAR NODE (Requires Status 10)

       This removes all line shuts involving the specified node.

       NSHUT NODE (Requires Status 10)

       This puts a shut in all lines on the specified node.



            COMMANDS WHICH EXTRACT INFORMATION TO THE LOGGER
            -------- ----- ------- ----------- -- --- ------

       EXTRACT NODE NODELIST

            EXTRACT will generate current log reports from certain nodes
       and  provide  messages  of  interest  to operations such as 'HOST
       DOWN', 'OUT OF DBITS' and so on.  To specify all  relevant  bases
       within a computer center, a code may be typed:

               CUPERTINO BUILDING A    700
               CUPERTINO BUILDING C    701
               PALO ALTO               702
               HOUSTON                 703
               VALLEY FORGE            704

            The format of this  PROBE  command  is  'EXTRACT  NODE  NODE
       LIST'.   For example if you type 'EXTRACT 1 701, this will report
       data from all bases in Cupertino C plus  base  1.   If  you  type
       'EXTRACT  703'  the program will report only information on SCO -
       Tymshare's computer center in Houston Texas.

       LOG TIME

            The 'LOG TIME' command starts the logger output  of  all  or
       specified  information  on  all  hosts,  lines  and  nodes in the
       network.  The valid formats to this command are:

       LOG 100         Start 100 minutes before now.
       LOG 123:12:30   Start on the 123 day of the year, 12 hour,
                       30 minutes. The time is in GMT.
       LOG             Start now.
       LOG S10         Start 10 minutes ago. Print each record with
                       the time to the nearest second.
       LOG H5          Start 5 minutes ago. Print all records in hex.
       LOG B3          Start 3 blocks before current supervisor
                       position. A block is 64 entries.
                       This is useful when time is scrambled.

            The PROBE LOG command will allow the option of single letter
       qualifiers  which  modify  what information will be output and in
       what format.  The S qualifier instructs the program  to  print  a
       time  to  the  nearest  second  with  each record output.  If the
       qualifier H is used all records output will  be  in  hexadecimal.
       The  other  qualifiers  are  D (Disable) and X (eXceptions only).
       The D qualifier will ignore nonfatal  errors,  bad  records,  and
       certain  undecoded  errors.   The X qualifier will print out only
       host and line related information (Line Out, Reset, or  OK,  Host
       Up,  Down,  Answered,  or  Shut,  Host  Unhappy  bits).   The 'X'
       qualifier will override a D qualifier.

       ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))


            As mentioned earlier, all PROBE commands must  be  typed  in
       full.   In  general  if  an  operand is ommitted the program will
       assume 'ALL' was intended.  Any command can be aborted  by  using
       the Control Q or 'ESCAPE' key.

            Regarding login errors, the most common has been  forgetting
       that  the  password typein must be terminated by EITHER a CR or a
       semicolon (;) but NOT BOTH.  If you type both  the  program  will
       assume the CR was part of the probe user input and will loop with
       this incorrect input.  In cases where the login was  correct  but
       the  message  'PLEASE LOG IN' occurs instead of being logged into
       the INTERDATA, the  most  likely  cause  is  that  there  are  no
       available  job  slots  remaining on the machine.  Currently there
       are 12 available slots and often many of these must  be  used  in
       the field while corrective maintenance occurs on the net.
