                 TYMCOM-IX BASE CRASHES AND RECOVERIES
                  -------- ---- ------- --- ----------


       ((INTRODUCTION))

            Since the Tymbase provides network access to two  hosts,  if
       either host crashes, the base will continue to function as a node
       in Tymnet.  But if the base crashes, the  base  will  crash  both
       hosts  connected  to that base;  a host without a base is cut off
       from the outside world and cannot timeshare effectively.  A large
       majority  of  base  crashes will be self-recovering for the base.
       This means that the base has routines within  itself  to  dump  a
       copy  of  it's  core image into the respective hosts for analysis
       later on.  After the base has  dumped  itself,  it  crashes  both
       hosts  connected  to  it  and  returns  to  it's normal operation
       automatically.

            Occasionally however, the Tymbase will hangup in a  loop  or
       simply  stop  functioning and display the 'step' light.  In these
       cases the operator must follow the procedures described  in  this
       document  in  order  that  the  base crash code can be saved, the
       hosts can be halted in an orderly fashion and  the  base  can  be
       returned to normal functioning through a TYMNET CONTROL initiated
       downstream base code load.

            Always  remember  to  keep  TYMNET  NETWORK  CONTROL  CENTER
       informed  on the status of any unusual activity that is occurring
       on any base.

BASE CRASH SUMMARY


       ((COMMAND SUMMARY))


                                     NOTE

           Full details on all  summarized  procedures  are  in  the
           COMMAND DESCRIPTION section of this document.


               1) ANNOUNCE THE CRASH OVER THE COMLINE SPEAKER AND
                  CONTACT NETCON TO ADVISE THEM OF THE SITUATION;

               2) CHECK IF THE BASE IS IN STEP. IF NOT AND THE BIT LAMPS
                  ARE NOT FLICKERING FAINTLY THE BASE IS LOOPING.

               3) FOR 620L-100 BASES TURN THE FRONT PANEL KEY TO 'ON'
                  TO UNLOCK THE CONSOLE. IF THE BASE WAS LOOPING HIT THE
                  'STEP' SWITCH.

               4) CHECK AND RECORD THE FOLLOWING REGISTERS:
                  ON 620 BASES         RECORD P,U,A,B AND X REGISTERS

               5) CLEAR THE REGISTERS AND ATTEMPT TO RESTART FROM
                  P LOCATION 0; THIS DUMPS BASECODE TO THE 940.
                  AS THIS IS DONE THE 940'S WILL CRASH (IF THEY 
                  HAVEN'T CRASHED EARLIER). THIS PROCEDURE WILL
                  USUALLY CORRECT THE PROBLEM.

               6) IF RESTART FROM 0 FAILS, CONTACT NETWORK CONTROL AND
                  REQUEST A FRESH COPY OF THE BASE CODE BE LOADED OVER
                  THE NETWORK USING THE DOWNSTREAM LOADING PROTOCOL;

               7) IF NETCON IS UNABLE TO LOAD THE BASE, CHECK AND IF
                  NECESSARY CORRECT THE BOOTSTRAP FOR THAT BASE;

               8) WAIT A FEW MINUTES, THEN LOG A NEARBY TTY INTO PROBE.
                  CHECK THE STATUS OF THE BASE YOU JUST RESTARTED OR
                  OR NETCON JUST RELOADED WITH THE PROBE PROGRAM;

               9) IF THE BASE IS RUNNING PROPERLY, BRINGUP THE HOSTS
                  CONNECTED TO IT FOR TIMESHARING;

               10) LEAVE A THOROUGH RECORD OF WHAT YOU DID WITH THE
                  M.A.R. YOU GIVE YOUR LEAD OPERATOR AND IN THE SYSTEM
                  LOGBOOK.

BASE SAVE DESCRIPTION


       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))
                                   1.

            From time to time the automatic self-recovery of  a  Tymbase
       crash will not occur.  Generally if portions of the base code are
       clobbered, correcting the situation  depends  on  the  operator's
       ability  to  coordinate  the  appropriate  procedures with TYMNET
       NETWORK CONTROL.  There are over 10,000 instructions  in  a  base
       code.   These  instructions  can  be  reflected  in  the  various
       registers  of  the  minicomputer.   Part  of  this  code  is  the
       BOOTSTRAP - a series of instructions which the base uses to bring
       itself to a functioning state by loading and running the rest  of
       the code.

            If any type of base crash  occurs,  both  hosts  interfacing
       TYMNET through that base will crash.  As with any host crash, you
       should announce the crash over the  loudspeaker.   When  you  see
       both  hosts  on  a  base  crash you should check that base before
       bringing up either 940.  Generally the Tymbase will have  already
       dumped  it's code into 940 core and the hosts can be brought back
       up.  When you load the TYMCOM-IX monitor with  'UP;G'  the  crash
       code  will  be  saved  to  a  special  area  on disk 0.  Then the
       2CRASHSAVE program (during OPCOM) will include it  in  the  crash
       save files.

                                   2.

            If however, the base is unable to recover, then  all  logins
       to the host will fail and the message 'HOST NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH
       NET' will type out.  By this time, the operator should have begun
       to  suspect  a  base problem requiring manual intervention.  When
       the base crashes and is not able to restart  itself  the  machine
       will  either be in 'STEP' (that is the STEP light will be lit and
       there will be no activity in any of the register lights)  or  the
       machine  will  be  hung up in a loop (in which case the lights on
       the console will not be flickering).  Additional  symptoms  of  a
       non-recovering  base  crash  can  be  obtained by using the PROBE
       program to check the status of the base from the vantage  of  the
       network  supervisor.   This  program  is  documented  in  another
       section of this manual.



                                     NOTE

           For the following description you  are  referred  to  the
           console diagram on the page after next.


                                                                  Page 4
BASE SAVE DESCRIPTION


                                   3.


            The first recovery procedure is to turn the  console  enable
       key  to  the  'ON' position to 'unlock' the 620L-100 console.  If
       the base is not is STEP, press the 'STEP' key to stop the machine
       from looping.

                                   4.

            At this point you should record the contents of  the  base's
       registers.  To do this on the 620 L-100 type base (TYMCOM-IX) you
       must push each of the register switches (labeled  from  right  to
       left) 'P, U, A, B and X to the down position one at a time.  When
       each switch is  in  the  down  position,  the  contents  of  that
       register  will be displayed as an octal number in the data lights
       labeled (right to left) 0 through 15.  This information should be
       recorded in the form 'P=NNNNNN, U=NNNNNN' etc.

                                   5.

            Once you have recorded all of the registers one at  a  time,
       proceed  to  clear each register.  To do this put each individual
       register in the down position, press the BIT  RESET  button,  and
       then  put the register key back to the up position.  When the BIT
       RESET button is pushed the light in the data display  will  reset
       to  0 (all lights out).  Proceed with the same procedure with the
       next register and continue until all registers have been cleared.

            Next attempt to restart the base from P location 0.   To  do
       this press the SYSTEM RESET button twice and then the RUN button.
       The code should now be running.  A  restart  from  P  location  0
       dumps  the  Tymbase  into 940 core on both hosts connected to the
       base.  If this procedure succeeds the lights in the data  display
       will begin to flicker, and the RUN light should remain on.

            It always takes at least two minutes for a restarted base to
       be  recognized  by the network.  You should use the PROBE program
       to verify that the base has restarted correctly.  If so,  proceed
       to bring the hosts back up.

                                   6.

            If restarting the code from 0 fails, chances  are  the  base
       will  go  into step.  If that happens, or if the network does not
       acknowledge the base restart within PROBE after  3  minutes,  the
       next  corrective  procedure  is to contact TYMNET NETWORK CONTROL
       (408 446-6180 or ext.  6468) and request that they force the base
       to  it's appropriate synchronous bootstrap location, load a fresh
       copy of basecode from downstream and start it running.  Base code
       for  the  940's  is contained in diskfiles on either system 33 or
       system 36 under directory  (TYMNET).   Under  normal  situations,
       this  code  can  be  loaded over TYMNET so long as both hosts are
       down and the base is in the network.  However, at this point,  it
       is assumed that the base is in step, that the registers have been
       recorded (step 4 above) and cleared (step 5 above) and  that  you
       have  already  tried  the  less drastic measure of restarting the
       Tymbase from P=0.  If both hosts are not yet down, use breakpoint
       4  to  crash  them.   Contact  NETWORK CONTROL and find out which
       network line from the base will be used for the  downstream  code
       load.   If they indicate the current net line set up for the base
       load, go over to the base and put  the  'P'  register  key  down.
       Enter  an  octal 37640 into the data display.  When you have done
       this hit the SYSTEM RESET button twice, then hit RUN.  From  this
       point, NETCON can proceed with the reload.

                                  NOTE

       The bootstrap start location above reflects a  620  with  16K  of
       core (standard).  If however the 620 has

               12K of core    use     P=27640
               20K of core    use     P=47640
               24K of core    use     P=57640

                                   7.

            If however, NETCON indicates that some line other  than  the
       current  line will be used for the downstream code load, you will
       have to check and possibly change the contents of five  locations
       in the bootstrap before proceeding to start the synchronous boot.
       The locations and contents to  be  changed  in  these  cases  are
       listed below.

            This table can also be  used  to  determine  which  line  is
       currently  set  up  for the downstream load.  For example, if you
       check the 16k 620 value of bootstrap location 37655 and  find  it
       contains  50040,  then  line  0 (the default) is the current line
       setting for the code load.

            The table  below  contains  the  appropriate  locations  and
       contents  necessary  to  load  basecode  downstream  from various
       network  lines.   Refer  to  the  procedure  under   ERRORS   AND
       RECOVERIES  for  details  on  how  to  examine  and  change these
       locations.

            If the base reload fails you may have to manually reload the
       base bootstrap;  The procedure for this is detailed in the ERRORS
       AND RECOVERIES section of this document.

                                   8.

            If this base load was a success, the the initial evidence is
       that  the RUN and OVFL lights stay on and the data display lights
       (esp.   bit  10)  flicker  faintly.   Conclusive  evidence  of  a
       successful base reload comes from checking the status of the base
       node you just reloaded with the PROBE program.  Remember, it will
       take  the  Network Supervisor at lease 2 minutes to recognize the
       base again.

                                   9.

            If this procedure has succeeded, you can proceed to bring up
       both  940s for timesharing by typing UP;G to the selector channel
       DIM.  The dumped base crash will then be  saved  with  the  crash
       dump.

                                  10.

            Follow up whatever steps were necessary by writing a  M.A.R.
       outlining  the initial problem and what steps you took to correct
       the situation.

       ((SAMPLE RUN))

            See the command description above for the procedures and  an
       outline of the results of each step.


       ((ERRORS and RECOVERIES))

            Although the 620 bootstrap  seldom  gets  clobbered,  a  bad
       bootstrap is the most common reason for a base reload not working
       properly:  the mechanism for moving code from  940  core  to  620
       where it can run will be disabled if any part of the bootstrap is
       incorrect.  To identify this problem it is necessary to check the
       current  bootstrap  in  the  620L-100.   If any instruction(s) is
       found to deviate  from  the  correct  entry,  the  instruction(s)
       involved  must  be manually changed to the correct value.  Before
       outlining  these  techniques,  a  few   basic   definitions   are
       presented:


               P REGISTER             The P register is the program 
                                       location counter. This
                                       program counter is 16 bits long.

               U REGISTER             The U register is the instruction
                                       register of the CPU; 16 bits.

               A REGISTER             The A register is the accumulator
                                       register and is also 16 bits;
                                       the contents of a location are
                                       usually here.

               014000                  this is the 'LOAD A' register
                                       instruction; 10000 is 'load a'
                                       and 4000 is 'relative to the 'p'
                                       register. Use this to check.

               054000                  this is the 'STORE A' register
                                       instruction; 50000 is 'store a'
                                       and 4000 is 'relative to the 'p'
                                       register'. use this to correct.
                                                                  Page 9
CHECKING/RELOADING THE BOOTSTRAP


                    ((RELOADING SYNCHRONOUS BOOTS))

            With the downstream loader, the bootstrap used is  called  a
       'synchronous'  boot;   if  it  should  fail, you can reload it by
       first loading the older 'system' bootstrap for the 620.

       a) use the selector channel mode on the terminal to type UP;G  to
       DIM;  if you must do this remember to use UP-1;G when bringing up
       the host so you will avoid overwriting the original crash dump.

       b) to the prompt 'HOST:' you should type whichever host number is
       host 0 (the first number on the base label - eg.  C5 for C5-20B);

       c) to the 'LOC.:' prompt, type  11  (or  14)  to  load  the  file
       (TYMNET) SYNCLD;  this is the 'system' boot;

       d) on the 620 hit the reset key twice;

       e) set the 620 sense switches to indicate the octal number of the
       net line that will be used by NETCON for the downstream load;

       f) finally, hit RUN on the 620 to  start  the  synchronous  boot;
       NETCON can resume with the actual base code load at this point.


                       ((CHECKING THE BOOTSTRAP))

       1) THE 620L-100 MUST BE IN 'STEP';  IF NOT HIT 'STEP'.

       2) CLEAR ALL THE REGISTERS (SEE STEP 5 IN THE COMMAND DESCRIPTION
       ABOVE ON HOW TO DO THIS).

       3) SET THE 'REPEAT' KEY ON;  SELECT THE 'U'  REGISTER  AND  ENTER
       14000;  SELECT THE 'P' REGISTER AND ENTER 37640 (OR WHICHEVER THE
       LOCATION IS YOU WISH TO CHECK).  NEXT SELECT THE 'A' REGISTER.

       4) GET A HARDCOPY OF THE CORRECT BOOTSTRAP LISTING OR  THE  TABLE
       CONTAINING  THE  FIVE LOCATIONS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING WHICH NET
       LINE WILLSED FOR THE DOWNSTREAM BASE LOAD.  HIT  'STEP'  AND
       THE ENTRY FOR THAT LOCATION IN THE CURRENT BASE BOOTSTRAP WILL BE
       SHOWN AS AN OCTAL  NUMBER  IN  THE  DATA  DISPLAY.   IF  YOU  ARE
       CHECKING  THE ENTIRE BOOTSTRAP, THIS SHOULD MATCH THE FIRST OCTAL
       ENTRY ON YOUR LIST.  FOR CHECKING THE FIVE LOCATIONS INVOLVED  IN
       NET  LINE  FOR  THE LOAD, THIS SHOULD MATCH THE APPROPRIATE VALUE
       CONTAINED IN THE LINE TABLE IN  THIS  DOCUMENT.   IF  IT  IS  NOT
       CORRECT,  MARK  THAT  LOCATION ON YOUR HARDCOPY SO THAT LATER YOU
       CAN CHANGE THAT ENTRY IN THE 620L-100 BOOTSTRAP.

       5) TO MOVE ON TO THE  NEXT  INSTRUCTION  IN  THE  BOOTSTRAP,  HIT
       'STEP'  AGAIN.   THIS WILL INCREMENT THE 'P' REGISTER AND DISPLAY
       THE  NEXT  BOOTSTRAP  ENTRY  IN  THE  DATA  LIGHTS.   REPEAT  THE
       COMPARISON  WITH THE BOOTSTRAP LISTING AND MAKE A MARK IF THE 620
       ENTRY IS INCORRECT.  IF YOU WISH TO CHECK THE  ENTIRE  BOOTSTRAP,
       TO  DO  THIS  PROCEED  TO  DISPLAY  EACH  SUCCESSIVE ENTRY IN THE
       BOOTSTRAP BY HITTING 'STEP'.
                                                                 Page 10

                    ((CORRECTING A BOOTSTRAP ENTRY))

       6) NOW, REFERRING TO THE INCORRECT ENTRIES YOU'VE CHECKED ON  THE
       BOOTSTRAP  LIST, (OR, TO THE LIST OF THE FIVE LOCATIONS THAT NEED
       TO BE MODIFIED TO LOAD FROM A NET LINE  OTHER  THAN  THE  CURRENT
       LINE  SETTING)  SELECT  THE  'U' REGISTER AND ENTER 54000;  NEXT,
       SELECT THE 'P' REGISTER AND ENTER  WHICHEVER  BOOTSTRAP  LOCATION
       CONTAINS  THE ENTRY YOU WISH TO CHANGE;  SELECT THE 'A' REGISTER.
       HIT 'BIT RESET' TO CLEAR THE DATA DISPLAY LIGHTS.

       7) INTO THE 'A' REGISTER YOU SHOULD KEYIN THE CORRECT  ENTRY  FOR
       THE  LOCATION  THAT IS IN THE 'P' REGISTER.  NOW HIT 'STEP' ONCE.
       REPEAT THE PROCEDURES 6 AND 7 FOR EACH ENTRY YOU NEED TO CHANGE.

       8) WHEN ALL THE APPROPRIATE ENTRIES HAVE BEEN MADE,  RECHECK  ALL
       THE  CHANGES (WITH PROCEDURES 1 THRU 5) TO MAKE SURE THE 620L-100
       NOW CONTAINS THE EXACT SAME ENTRY FOR EACH LOCATION AS  YOU  HAVE
       ON THE BOOTSTRAP LIST OR LINE TABLE.

       9) IF NOT, REDO THIS ENTIRE  PROCEDURE  UNTIL  THE  BOOTSTRAP  IS
       CORRECT;   IF  IT  IS  CORRECT,  YOU  CAN  PROCEED TO RESTART THE
       BOOTSTRAP AND NOTIFY NETCON TO RESUME THE BASE CODE LOAD AGAIN.



            Occasionally when a power failure takes the base  down,  the
       620L-100  may be in a 'pwr checked' mode.  The key on the console
       would be on but none of the front panel switches would work.   If
       so, turn the key to 'OFF', then back to 'PWR ON'.

            If none of the above  procedures  correct  a  base  problem,
       contact TYMSHARE MAINTENANCE for assistance.
