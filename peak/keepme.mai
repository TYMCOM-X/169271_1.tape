    Carl,

    The VMFILE sources in your directory seem to have undergone a change
    since I last listed them.  Was there anything significant done to them?
    Should I not try to use the VMFILE module for PRT?

Oh yes... I added a few more routines and started working on making it
read "backwards" (which it doesn't quite do yet).  I don't know what
version you printed... but it should be useable... if it doesn't seem
to work right, then get the current copy and try again... If I break
something, I'll tend to put it back or fix it... so whatever is on my
directory should be in useable condition...

at this very instant, I'm modifying how something works, but it should
not have broken anything... I'll let you know in about 1/2 hr, as I was
just about to test it when I saw your message...

    When I enter PEAK with a job number corresponding to an existing

    We discussed the treatement of lonely CRs, but I cannot recall how they
    are to be detected procedurally.  Did you actually deal with them yet?

They are not detectable.... i.e.   DATA-CR-DATA-CR-LF  looks like
                                     DATA-DATA-CR-LF  (I think).
You'll have to try it yourself to be sure.  If I detect a CR just
prior to an EOL then VMGETC(S,VM$ECR)='15 else it =0.  The way this
is implemented is that I ignore CRs all the time as a character.  If
I see one, I set a flag.  At eol I return whatever is available.  If
I see any other character, I clear the flag (going forwards) and don't
do anything going backward.  So, DATA-CR-DATA-LF going backward will
appear as the same as DATA-DATA-CR-LF  and forward as DATA-DATA-LF.
{sigh}.

I think this is how it works... the solution is to not do overstriking
and all works fine.  For normal source files, there isn't any kind
of problem.  Only for funny DDT and other files would there be a problem.

Subject: Ohmigosh! VMFILE changed! 

Well, I decided that I needed the capability to WRITE files using my new
mapping package VMFILE as well as just being able to read them. So,...

  Slot_ VMFILE( StringFilename, AccessMode(0) )
	where access mode is [0]=Read,[1]=Write-single-access,[2]=Update-
	single access,[3]=Multiple-update.

  Bool_ VMTEXT( Slot, StringTextMessage )
	where text message can be any length sail will accept.  it may
	just as well be multiple lines. It works! great! even!

  Value_ VMGETC( Slot, VM$Msg )      ::= # of text messages ending with ^D
  Value_ VMGETC( Slot, VM$MSize )    ::= # of text messages in file ... ^D
  Value_ VMGETC( Slot, VM$Access )   ::= Access mode used by VMFILE call.

  Line_ VMLINE( Slot, Break, Dir(0) )
	such that ^D is now included in the class of "line-break" characters
	and a text messge of L1<crlf>L2<crlf><^D> is 3 lines long and one
	message long.  I've thought that it might be nice to allow ^D to go
	away and use the old behavior, but I can't imagine anyone who would
	want ^D as a text charcter, so unless you demand a way to make it
	a transparent character again... sigh!

For more details, I've updated VMFILE.REQ with some of hte changes to the
documentation, and VMFOO.SAI uses the new features reasonably well.
I hope I didn't spoil your listings again... oh well!  Ohmigosh!

Subject: VMFILE release! 

Ken,
  While finishing up the last set of things for VMFILE, I undertook
the task of the lone Carriage-return!  The way it's setup to work...

    Text_ VMLine( Slot, EolBreak, Direction(default=0) )

    Text      contains the line of data, or null for blank lines.

    EolBreak  contains #LF for normal lines, #FF for page marks,
              #VT if present, #EOT (^D) if present for message texts,
              #CR if a carriage-return was seen without a #LF, or
              #NUL (^@ or 0) if at the end of file.

    To check to see if the line was terminated by a CRLF, or CRFF, or
    CRVT the value returned by VMGetC(slot,VM$ECR) will have a #CR if
    seen, otherwise will be 0.

    To determine if at the end of file, Text must be null and EolBreak
    must contain a 0, otherwise there may be a string in Text without
    a valid end-of-line when at the end, or you may have a blank line.

It seems to work both directions quite well.  I'm not sure if it keeps
track of the message or page counts correctly, but I think it does now.
Let me know if you find any problems.

    I presume you got the mail about VMTEXT, so I won't repeat myself.
    Feel free to give me a call, whenever to talk about it.  Although,
    I may be unavailable for parts of tomorrow, since it so  "happens"
    that Cherie & I will be married exactly 6 months tomorrow.

    Correct me if I'm right:  It seems that I recently discovered that

After reading your mail and checking the code, I guess I saw that I left
in the code which looked for files in your AUN if you didn't specify any
username.  Since 
all my testing was in my directory, i never noticed it.

I've put in code which expects to run on a P034/P or later monitor.  We
added a few GETTABS which are nice.  '30 & '31 which are DEC's username
table entries,  *** OOPS *** well, P034/P01 and later?, I'll check ***
and we store the GFD username there instead.  (In one version, we just
make these point to .GTUNM & .GTUN1, maybe /P maybe not).  Anyway, when
you GFD someplace the monitor puts the GFD username in these locations and
only "MAGIC" programs can somehow set these to 0.

Anyway, if no usrername is passed, I read these GETTAB entries.  It works
correctly on 930, even if it doesn't work elsewhere YET!  As soon as the
next monitor goes out, it will work everywhere, since that shouldn't take
too too long, 'cause it is needed everywhere for my new PERP to work...
/Carl

Also, VMFREE now takes a second argument, added so I can use VMFREE to
rename (delete) a file I've been writing.  The second argument is labeled
BITS and if -1 will delete a file that was open for writing/update/etc,
and any other non-zero value will be used as bits to the CLOSE uuo.  BUT,
the only useful bits are things to ignore access and such, 'cause just
closing the input or output side will have unfortunate effects since the
next uuo in sequence is a RELEASE!

    It seems that the remaining nulls were due to instances of the

    to only append "Tmp" and "Brk" onto the result when they are nonzero;
    and this seems adequate to remove spurious nulls from the output.  Is

    Each time I embark on a new development project with the monolithic

    'get-first/get-next' paradigm for iterating through wildcard specs?".
    This time I thought I'd ask you as well.  No doubt there was a very

    I increment the design of PUT to the next step (adding wildcard

Sigh... is there really that much redesign?  Think of the calls that
you setup as "WHILE (ANY-FILES-MATCHING-SPEC) DO FILE-PROC" with the
UFD-PROC as an invisible filter...

By the way, I didn't design it the way it is... DWS did it and called it
FILSCN which Adele had me look at it and speed it up, which I did.  Anyway
the idea is sound... but the general case most people only want the two
procedures, UFDPROC, FILEPROC and for single directories, only FILEPROC
has any meaning.  I wish you could OMIT procedures... HMMMMMM... you can
have default arguments, I wonder if you can have default procedures, and
put the procedures it uses inside MFDSCN?   HMMMMM....

response  to  ISG's  performance improvement program.  In concert
with  ISG's  performance  improvement  program  and moratorium on
promotions,  these  organizations  are being put in place with no
increase in headcount and no promotions.

Information   Systems   Group  purchases  currently  exceed  $300
million  per year and represent a sustaining opportunity for cost
and  quality  optimization.    Don,  Bob, Coy and Karen and their
staffs  are  dedicated  to  obtaining maximum value for every ISG
purchase  dollar.    Please  give them your full support in their
efforts.

    Bill,

    Just checking to see if you realize that your account on :36 has
    expanded by 16K pages since the 18th of November.  Is this expected, or
    is there a runaway condition somehwere?

    Just Checking:

    Does (UFD) freak DUSAGE out?  I just did one on :36, and found that
    DUSAGE reported that (UFD)'s usage went from 1407 to 0 since a few days
    ago.  I suppose that there is "no problem" since I'm able to log in,
    but I'm curious as to whether DUSAGE cn make sense of the (UFD)
    directory.

Following is a list of Tymnet to Bubbnet gateway hosts.  You can use
these host numbers to build a circuit through a particular gateway.
To do this, enter:

    <your username>:<gateway host number>;<password>

at the please login prompt or:

    ;c   <your username>:<gateway host number>

when building a circuit from NAD.

The gateway hosts are:

    390, 1461, 1579, 2633, 5516, and 7255.

There are others listed as gateway hosts, but I haven't been able to
verify them yet.  I'll send out an updated list when I'm finished.

We finally have a date!  January 10 is what we're planning for.  Rob Albertson
is coordinating the move and will be in touch with each of you who are in any
way affected.  And, as he will be on vacation until January 2, if there are
any things that need tending to before then, I'll handle them.

May each of you have a Happy Holiday and, for those of you I won't see until
after January 1, Happy New Year!

Subject: Re: (spl)type and the (yetch) scanset printer 

Ken,
  I've located the lobotomized sources to TYPE and was interested in adding
your SCANSET printer.  I'd swear that you sent me something on paper, but I
was unable to find it the other day when I left the office.

  I located a SCANSET 410 & 415 manual and what it says conflicts with what
you sent me in the messafge I am replying to.  Also, I am unclear to your
meaning:  e.g.
            ESC & "A1"  direct the ensuing data traffic to the printer

is this:  ESC & A 1   or is it  ESC A 1  ???  I will assume it is the former.
                                              since ESC & x x certainly will
                                              cause a HP26xx terminal grief.

The manual I have says nothing of pitch, but says that...
  ESC ; 0     Close printer port
  ESC ; 1     Open printer port, no char display, trap commands
  ESC ; 2     Open printer port, dispaly characters
  ESC ; 3     PRINT SCREEN
  ESC ; 4     Open printer port, transparent display until ESC ; 0 seen

I'd like to add /DEVICE:SCANSET but I think I need more info.  I'll get
back to you as soon as you get back to me.

/Carl

Well,
  /DEV:SCANSET  will be the one in my manual
  /DEV:ADM11P   will be the one used by PUT.SAI

and I saw you mean ESC A 0  and  ESC A 1 without the ampersand !
Will send mail whane it's testable.

Subject: TYPE / TYPER 

(SPL)TYPER on 930 now runs (SYS)TYPE instead of (MPL)TYPE.
(SYS)TYPE  on 930 now has /DEVICE:TI820 /DEVICE:SCANSET /DEVICE:ADM11P
                  in addition to the old /DEVICE:TTY and /DEVICE:LA50

/HPITCH takes 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16  as values. For ADM-11P it uses
                  /HPITCH:5 for proportional and 10, 12, 16 as designated.

Not having such a device, I cannot test it.  /DEV:SCANSET is implemented
as per my SCANSET manual, but there are NO guarantees!  Sigh!

                          The Ontyme Support Tool
                               (in MAGNUM!)

1       It seems that the Modify command does not allow access to all
        fields, nor is it clear which fields pertain to Hardware and which
        pertain to Software.

2       An explanation of each field which does not assume I know what is
        going on a priori should be availible.  It should (if possible)
        refer to the message formats currently in vogue among the
        Operations people.

3       Somehow, it would be nice to know what to do with incomplete (ie,
        missing) information.  For instance, if the ending time of the OPC
        is not known, maybe we want to not specify the beginning time.

4       Maybe a command should be availible to convert from Software to
        Hardware, and vice versa.  The advantage in this is that
        inconsistencies can be reviewed and obviated.  (Remember that the
        fields associated with one type are not those associated with the
        other.)

5       Identify on the report whether it is a Hardware or Software report.
        I can't tell the difference.

6       On the Report All option, identify the first section as "Status",
        and the second as "Summary".

7       As always, implement this and all tools in SAIL.

This paper is the  result  of  research  performed  as part of an undergraduate
directed study at Boston University.  Computer Mediated  Communication
literature  has  indicated a potential for addiction in users of Computer  Mail
 systems.   A questionnaire  was  designed  to  characterize the nature of the
addiction.  Self identified  addicts were  recruited  with  public  messages on
several nationwide computer networks.   The  questionnaire was then distributed
and returned using electronic mail.

     Modern electronic computer  networks  offer  users  the
ability to deliver messages with greater ease and speed than
ever before.  Distant friends and colleagues  can  continue,
or  establish  communication on a daily basis without regard
to differences in time zone or schedules.  Messages  can  be
sent  across  the  globe  in  minutes  and  be  read  at the
recipient's choice  of  time  and  location.   Messages  are
devoid  of visual, verbal, and non-verbal contact; there are
no physical cues, no handwriting, or  even  paper  that  has
been  touched  by  the  sender.  The only traditional medium
that begins to offer the equivalent speed, freedom, and phy-
sical  record  of  computer  mail  is the Telegram.  However
Telegrams are far more expensive  and  not  nearly  as  con-
venient.   It is not surprising therefore that computer mail
(or computer mediated communication) should  have  affective
and behavioral impacts differing from traditional communica-
tion channels.

     One effect on users of electronic message systems  that
has  been  observed  is the potential for addiction. (Hiltz,
1978) A possible definition for this addiction is  returning
to  the  terminal,  more  than...  work of information alone
would at first seem to justify . (Kerr, 1982)

     Several reasons for this phenomena have been suggested.
The  first is that electronic communication is a highly pro-
fitable behavior.  For little cost, or  outlay  of  physical
effort  a user can receive far more messages than they send.
A second theory is that because of the high availability  of
information  users  can  become overloaded easily. (Kleiner,
1979) To avoid this situation the user  feels  compelled  to
check  for messages more frequently.  The last hypothesis is
that electronic mail is attractive to individuals  who  feel
awkward   communicating   using   traditional   means.   The
anonymous  nature  of  computer  mediated  communication  is
disinhibiting (Festinger, 1952) and allows them a freedom of
expression they do not usually enjoy.  To examine the  above
ideas  it  was  decided  to  issue  a questionnaire to self-
identified addicts.

METHOD

     Use of the word  addiction  was  carefully  considered.
Although  it has negative connotations, it is clearly under-
stood, and is less negative  than  nerd  or  obsessive.   To
recruit  volunteers a ten item preliminary questionnaire was
posted with a  request  that  the  message  be  reposted  to
interested  parties.   The  message asked for users who felt
that they were addicted to electronic mail.  The  definition
of  addiction  was  left  unqualified.  It was felt that the
perception of addiction was subjective and might well differ
from  subject  to  subject.   A  total of 136 responses were
received, from 116 males and 20 females; 47  were  from  the
ARPAnet  community,  12 from Boston University Computer Sci-
ence systems, 26 from users of the Digital Equipment  inter-
nal  ENet,  and 51 from users on systems connected via UUCP.
The final questionnaire was then designed  with  refinements
from the preliminary answers.

     The questionnaire contained 70  questions;  28  initial
demographic  and  usage pattern questions, 26 questions on a
five point likert scale on  attitudes  regarding  electronic
and  traditional media, and 16 open ended questions evaluat-
ing the subject's feelings about their  addiction.   Of  136
full  questionnaires sent out, 66 replies were received; two
were explicit refusals to answer the questions, and one  was
answered  a  quarter  of  the way through before the subject
quit.  The remaining 63 responses were coded, for an overall
yield of 46%.

     An attempt was made to recruit subjects  on  the  large
campus IBM system, as a very broad spectrum of the undergra-
duate population have accounts on  the  system.  Many  users
appear to log in to the system just to use the mail facility
called "$MSG".  However no subjects returned the full  ques-
tionnaire.

RESULTS

     Of the 70 questionnaire items 61 were analyzed.  Of the
63  Ss, 55 were male (87%), and 8 were female (12%).  The Ss
came from 17 states of the U.S.,  1  Canadian  province  and
three  foreign countries (Holland, Norway, and Switzerland).
One subject returned their answers by postal mail, all  oth-
ers  used electronic mail.  The range for ages was 19 to 50,
the modal age was 28, with a mean of 29.2, variance of  7.1.
The  average  user  has  been using computers for 10.5 years
(mode 10, variance 4.7), but has been  using  computers  for
communications  for a mean of 5.3 years (modes 2,5, variance
3.3). 86% use computers extensively in the line of work, 35%
have  family  members  that use electronic mail, and 22% use
electronic mail to communicate  with  family  members.   The
biggest use of computers was Systems programming (20%), fol-
lowed by text preparation,  and  computer  science  research
(both  19%); 11% used computers primarily for communication.
39% said their primary community was the  ARPA/MILnet/CSnet,
30%  said  usenet/UUCP,  and  22%  were users of the Digital
internal EasyNet.

     A large number of Ss felt they had started  using  Com-
puters  in general because of school (46%), followed by per-
sonal interest (39%), only 11% felt they had  started  using
computers  because of their job.  However 42% felt that they
had started to use computers for  communication  because  of
their  job,  44% from personal interest, and only 9% because
of school; 60% felt that their addiction had been caused  by
use of electronic communication in their work setting.

     The average user spends  44  hours/week  on-line  (mode
45hrs  (16%),  variance  of  18,  range 10 to 80).  For most
users 90% of this time is business related, the other 10% is
recreational;  10%  of  the tie on line is spent in business
related communication, and 10%  in  recreational  communica-
tion.   The  average addict logs in 10 times/week explicitly
for communications purposes (range 0  to  30).   Most  users
(mode)  receive  about 10 business related messages per week
(range 0 to 300), but send less than 5  (range  0  to  100).
Most users (mode) receive about 5 personal messages (range 0
to 400) and send about 5  (range  0  to  200).   Most  users
(mode)  read  about  200  public news/discussion group/NOTES
messages per week (range 0 to 4000), and the majority  (61%)
send less than 5.

     Subjects were asked to rate (on  a  five  point  likert
scale) how they would feel talking to a crowd, group, single
person, or using electronic mail for crowds,  groups,  etc..
consisting  of  friends  or  strangers.  For crowds, groups,
etc. consisting of friends the majority of  subjects  agreed
strongly  that they would feel comfortable addressing such a
group; electronic mail generated the largest number of  such
responses  (84%), with single friend (79%), group of friends
(77%), and crowd of friends (52%) following.  Speaking to  a
group  of  strangers  did  show a minor split; 32% responded
mildly agree, 29% responded mildly disagree.  The  responses
for  strongly  agree  for crowds, groups, etc showed a large
jump for electronic mail;  crowds  14%,  group  15%,  single
stranger 17%, electronic mail 41%.

     There was a strong consensus  for  "I  enjoy  receiving
postal  mail"; 49% responded strongly agree, while there was
a trend towards disagree for "I enjoy sending postal  mail".
There  was  also  a  division for "I would like it if postal
mail was delivered more than once a day",  with  39  on  the
agree side, 26% on the disagree side, and 30% in the middle.
There was a strong consensus for strongly agree to  both  "I
enjoy receiving electronic mail" (53%), and "I enjoy sending
electronic mail" (57%).  For the statement "I dislike  sign-
ing  on  and  finding  a very large number of messages", the
response was negative (63% disagree).

     55% felt that they often signed on  because  they  felt
"something might be waiting".  There was a slightly negative
response to the statement "I check for messages before I  go
to sleep".  The was a strong negative response to the state-
ments "I find my  involvement  with  computer  communication
interferes  with  other  social  activities", and "I find my
involvement with computer communication interferes with many
of my other activities (such as eating)"; over 70% responded
rarely or very rarely, 20% responded sometimes.

     34% of subjects reported  sometimes  feeling  irritated
when  the  system  was not available when they tried to sign
on; 20% said sometimes they showed signs of physical arousal
when  the  system  went down, but 44% said very rarely (most
negative).  20% reported they often felt the need to log  in
to avoid getting too many messages, while 38% reported feel-
ing this way very rarely.  55% reported that they often used
electronic mail when they could have made a phone call.  The
most often reported reason for this was to avoid  "Telephone
Tag", and to avoid interrupting the recipient.  However sub-
jects felt they rarely used electronic mail when they  could
have  had  a  face-to-face conversation.  There was a strong
negative response (79% said rarely) to the statement "I feel
the  need  to  get away from electronic communication".  The
majority of respondents (56%) said they rarely  were  logged
in between midnight and 5 am.

     The majority (84%) said that very  often  checking  for
electronic mail was the first thing they did in the morning;
77% of the population have terminals at home,  85%  reported
very often checking mail first thing in the morning.  Of the
remaining subjects  without  terminals  at  home  78%  still
reported  very  often checking mail first thing in the morn-
ing.

     When asked how many messages they could receive without
annoyance  37%  of  the  population  said  they had no upper
limit, 31.5% of the population had a limit of less  than  or
equal to 20 messages.  For public messages 36% said they had
no upper limit, 36.1% of the population had an  upper  limit
of  less timwer.

 find i52% said 3% said yesto answ wau be willing to  participate
in an interview?" 88% said yes, 11% said no.

CONCLUSIONS

     There are a number of questions I would have  liked  to
have asked that either were forgotten in the design process,
were suggested by subjects, or  came  up  in  analyzing  the
results;

   Would you send a love letter using computer mail?

   Do you ever carry a terminal when you travel?

   Have you ever been cut off from use of computer mail?

   What was your reaction?

   Do you ever see someone and say "I'll send you a message"?

   Have you had  problems  with  your  spouse  (or  significant other)
   regarding your addiction to computer mail?

   Do you feel you are better understood using computer mail?

   Do you ever use the telephone when you could  have  a  face-to-face
   conversation?

     And similarly there are many questions that I would not
have  asked,  or  asked  more  explicitly.  A data item that
could have been coded for analysis was  not  a  question  by
itself;  subjects  that  volunteered  for the interview were
asked to give a way contact them.  It should have been  pos-
sible  to  tabulate  the  type of "adds  useful  indicator
for other characteristics.

     An additional idea that bears more investigation is the
concept  that  computer  mail  addiction may 'mature'; users
become fanatical at first exposure, and slowly adapt  habits
that integrate use of electronic mail into daily life.

     There was little evidence  of  overload,  and  overload
induced  'dropout' (Kleiner, 1981) in the population.  It is
possible that this is  a  real  phenomena  but  not  visible
because  of  the  "hard-core" nature of the population.  The
population consisted of people who constantly use computers,
not  all  are programmers (there was one television producer
for example).  The majority of people felt they had  started
using  computer  mail, and had become addicted from use in a
work setting.  It is foreseeable that the increase of office
automation  technology  will  create  more addicts no longer
willing to put up with the slowness  of  traditional  media.
Many  subjects  referred  to postal mail as "Snail Mail", or
remarked that computer mail freed  them  from  the  game  of
"Telephone Tag".

Below is an explanation of a modification made to the
database which caused the slot hangs yesterday.  (I have
deleted the dump files which were stored in SLOTDUMP:36.)


             ss
FAE had a collision pointer of 3F79, which belongs to
ACS.B/LOUVIERE (ACS.B/LOUVIERE's id. actually hashes out
to FAE).

When the 'dead' user's id. was addressed using a debug
command, the address 3F7A in file user was given (an empty
block).  The mistake was made when the 3F79 collision
pointer (to ACS.B/LOUVIERE's profile) was changed to
3F7A in block FAE.  This created a loop with address FAE 
pointing to 3F7A and 3F7A pointing back to FAE.

Disaster struck when ACS.B/LOUVIERE attempted to log in.  
Since this id. hashed out to FAE, and the user stored at
FAE was not B/LOUVIERE; the collision pointer was looked
up (37FA), which pointed back to FAE.  Thus, the system
went in an infinite loop back and forth between the two
addresses.

The collision pointers were relinked and all is in order.
B/LOUVIERE should not have any problems logging in.

                   SETTING UP ONTYME ACCOUNTS
               **********************************
 
During the past several months, OnTyme Administration has been 
bombarded with new accounts being validated without proper 
control.  Not only does this affect the charge back of OnTyme 
service difficult, but duplicate accounts and previously used 
accounts are being set up.  In order to resolve the financial 
issue, Service Billing has indicated that if accounts are not set 
up within the agreed guidelines, they will remove the account 
without notice.  
 
We ask that those users with the level of authorization to set up 
accounts refrain from doing so.  Instead, a worksheet must be 
generated and the account validation procedure must occur from 
the Validation`s Department.*
 
To generate a worksheet, please type :EXEC *** ONTYME.WORKSHEET, 
answering the prompts.  A department or charge center must be 
included somewhere on the worksheet.  The worksheet will forward 
automatically when complete, to OnTyme Administration, where 
processing will take place.  If the account is urgently needed, 
we will comply by contacting the appropriate individuals involved 
in this procedure and ensuring the account is set up as soon as 
possible.

We thank you for your cooperation and remind you of the
implications behind setting up an account without proper
authorization.

Note :  The account, SUP, has been cleared by Service Billing as 
an account essential to bringing up an OnTyme host.  It is not 
necessary to send a worksheet in for this account.  However, no 
userids should be set up (SUP.SUP should be the only ID valid.)

Subject: File Pointer Problem? -- FYI 

To:  NTD.ONTYME
From:  Jeannine Ortiz
Re:  File Pointer Problem? -- FYI

-----------------------------------------------------

     What I'm about to describe may or may not be
directly related to the file pointer problem, but
I thought I'd bring it to your attention just the
same.

     The CLASS account on host 515 lost files.  A
thorough scrutinization of "ofile" brought three
file chains with CLASS's file hash to light.  One
of the file chains, however, had a different addr.
for the top of chain.  The TIBs for these files were
still intact and the creation/access dates of these
files were 1982 and 1983.  CLASS updates their
directory fairly frequently, so one would not expect
to find files last accessed three to four years ago.

     I relinked this chain back to the account after 
patching the back pointers to the top of the ofile
chain on all the blocks (each pointed to address 39)
and manually deleted them to free the TIBs.

     CLASS has been on 515 since January of '84 (they
were on host 2258 prior to that).  It appears as though
the old files were lost sometime in '84 and went 
unnoticed.  That makes sense; what doesn't (make sense),
is the top of chain pointer being 39 when it should be
1F0E.

     I don't recall any activity with this account in
the last two years which could be attributed to this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



The New Extended MAC Pascal Nucleus is ready for testing in our development
lab. This version only supports multi-meg slots. Testing of single meg slots
should use the production Pascal Nucleus.

The source is located at (SLLDCAIN:36)PNUC11.R12. A sample Slot TYM file is at
(SLLDCAIN:36)IN2105.T01. There are no changes to the TYM file.

Please use this new Nucleus with your current testing until a bug is
detected in the release.

This new Pascal Nucleus allows a process to use segments E and F for monitor
variables and stack space. This makes it possible to increase the current
OnTyme object code by 128K.

================================================

The public network will be supporting 14-bit node numbers.  There are
possibly several applications that expects node numbers to be always 12
bits or uses a 12-bit node number field.  Note that extending the node
numbers beyond 12 bits means that the octal representation is extended
to beyond 4 digits.  Please check your respective products ASAP.

SUBJECT>   Our Migration to the MDEMS Account


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The following describes our migration to the MDEMS account :
 
DATE                      ACTIVITY
====    ========================================================
 
1/16    All users now a part of MDEMS have new IDS in MDEMS 
        account.* 
 
        To login to your new MDEMS ID, type the following :
 
        At please log in:  EMSMDEMS
        At ID? MDEMS.xxx   <----`xxx` is same as your old ID
        At KEY? WELCOME_TO_MDEMS
 
        <"_" reflects spaces in your key.>
 
        Please change your KEY as soon as possible for security 
        precautions.  (We validated the long key in hopes you 
        would change it quickly!)  Read *** ONTYME21.NEWS for 
        details of the necessary format.
 
1/17    Announcement to `World` of our new account, MDEMS.  Users 
        will be instructed to begin sending to your new MDEMS IDS 
        on Monday, 1-28.
 
1/21    Begin using new MDEMS IDS to send your messages.  Login 
        to your 'old' ID and check for incoming messages.  
 
        Transfer any files you wished SAVED to your new MDEMS 
        userid.  ( SEE NOTES BELOW PLEASE )  It can be 
        accomplished by the following :
 
                                                                Page  2

        1- Login to `old` ID.
        2- :GET * filename
        3- :SEND MDEMS.xxx   <---- your new ID
        4- Logout of 'old' ID.
        5- Login to new MDEMS ID.
        6- :GET MSG#         
        7- :FILE * filename
 
1/17    If there are any SHARED (**) files in the accounts, ACS, 
thru    FTCC or NTD which need to be incorporated into the MDEMS 
1/28    shared directory, please let me know.  The LAST day to 
        submit a request to transfer shared files is 1/28. 
 
1/31    Your `old` ID is removed.
 
                    * * *   N O T E S   * * *
 
        Use a hard copy of your session when transferring your 
files.  It'll make it that much easier when you file the messages 
away.  
 
        Make sure you file away your messages by 1-31, as your 
'old' ID will be cancelled (which removes all messages sent!)

 
* THE NEW MDEMS ACCOUNT INCLUDES ALL OF FTCC, ONTYME MARKETING 
(formerly of ACS), and ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly of NTD).  
 
 
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me 
via OnTyme (MDEMS.L/METOUR) or phone 408 446-7588.
 
Cheers to the success '86 will bring to MDEMS!!

ONTYME MARKETING (formerly in ACS), ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly 
in NTD), and FRENCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (formerly FTCC) 
have folded into the new McDonnell-Douglas Company, Electronic 
Messaging Systems, MDEMS.  All users in the aforementioned 
accounts will now become part of the new OnTyme account, MDEMS.
 
Monday, January 28 is the date to remember.  Starting then, you 
must send OnTymes to the new account, MDEMS.  Any distribution 
lists which contain those users migrating to MDEMS should be 
modified to reflect the new account code as well.  
 
Both accounts, ACS and NTD will remain -- but the users now a 
part of MDEMS will no longer be valid in the 'old' accounts.  
FTCC will completely fold into the MDEMS account, so it will be 
removed in its entirety.
 
For simplicity sake, I have provided a list of those individuals 
who WERE NOT in the FTCC account.  (Just remember that all of 
FTCC will be MDEMS).  A complete directory can be pulled at your 
convenience, *** DIRECT.MDEMS.
 
Thanking you in advance for paying special attention to this 
announcement - we look forward to working with you in `86.

Due to a bout with the changing weather, I'm feeling a bit under
and will be reachable at home sporadically and by mail.  I'll let
you know when I make it back to the office.

PS:  You may have a couple of NTD people calling you about a monitor
     error message generated by PEAK when it's executing a CHANIO of
     some sort.  I took a quick look at it, but not enough to check
     which CHANIO to determine why it's getting the message.

Subject: tums and the new MDEMS ontyme acct 

    Seems we've been officially moved from NTD to MDEMS on ontyme.  I think
    I need to register MDEMS.K/DAWSON with TUMS.  The password is the same
    as before.

    Thanks,

Subject: The TUMS-SUP stuff 

    Jeanine,

    The stuff you received appeared because the username KEN was removed
    from the public net, and those who did it did not realize that the
    TUMS/ONTYME interface program on the PDP10s had KEN listed as the
    recipient of the Ontyme mail it was forwarding to me.  The problem has
    since been resolved, so just ignore the flack you caught from TUMS-SUP.

    Sorry for the headache.

Subject:  ISG MEDIA RELATIONS FUNCTION



I  am  pleased  to  announce  the  formalization of the ISG Media
Relations  function,  headquartered in Newport Beach, California,
and  reporting  to James R. Donovan, ISG Vice President-Marketing
and Planning.

Effective  immediately,  Peter  E. McGuirk, formerly ISG Director
of  Communications-West,  is  appointed Director-Media Relations.
Peter  has  over  20  years'  experience  in communication.  This
experience    includes    television   writing   and   commercial
production,   as   well  as  national  and  international  public
relations  responsibilities.    In  his  new  capacity,  he  will
establish  policy  for and coordinate all ISG media relations and
will  have  direct  responsibility  for Information Systems Group
press releases.

Major   emphasis   will   be  placed  on  those  media  relations
activities  that  can  raise  awareness  of ISG within our target
markets  while  highlighting  the  interrelationships  that exist
within  ISG.    Toward  that end, the responsible media relations
manager  in  each  of  our  companies  will  have  a  dotted-line
reporting relationship to Peter.

Ford  R.  Phillips  will  continue as Director-ISG Communications
and  will  assume responsibility for all marketing communications
activities  on  a  worldwide  basis,  including  those previously
handled   by   Peter  McGuirk.    Ford,  as  before,  reports  to
David  M.  Rousseau,  ISG  Staff Vice President-Marketing, and is
responsible  for  Information Systems Group advertising, employee
communications,   marketing   communications  and  organizational
identity activities.

Peter   and   Ford   will   be   jointly   responsible   for  the
Communications Councils which have been established within ISG.

To:       MDISG Lists A - E, MDAIS Lists A - E

Subject:  MDIPC NETWORK SERVICES



1.  Effective  immediately,  R.  J. Luetkemeyer, Director, Client
    Services  is assigned responsibility for the Network Services
    function within MDIPC.

2.  It  is the intent that this function, as appropriate, arrange
    for  the  use  of  the  services  of  TYMNET,  MDAIS  Network
    Services  and,  in  limited  cases,  external  communications
    organizations.

3.  In  this  capacity,  it  will  be  Dick's  responsibility  to
    establish  a  function  within  MDIPC which will serve as the
    focal  point for providing the appropriate network connection
    to  the  MDIPC  processors  in  support  of the business unit
    requirements for computing and processing services.

4.  To accomplish the above, Dick will:

    4.1   Identify  and arrange for the separation of ISG network
          equipment and costs from the MDAIS pools.

    4.2   Establish  the appropriate accounting controls and cost
          distribution   to   assure  proper  management  of  the
          service.

    4.3   Identify  those services which should be purchased from
          MDAIS   rather   than   duplicated  and  establish  the
          appropriate forecast and budget to meet these needs.

    4.4   Establish  an  interface  relationship with the Network
          Services  Company  to  assure that appropriate services
          of  TYMNET are used in conjunction with the services of
          MDIPC.

    4.5   Identify  costs  which  are  uniquely related to only a
          specific   business   and   develop   a   process   for
          "unbundling"  so  that  only  benefiting units bear the
          costs.

5.  Since  the  primary  purpose of this function is to provide a
    necessary   service,   Dick   will  use  existing  functional
    organizations   where   appropriate  to  avoid  duplicity  in
    function.    Further  announcements will be published under a
    separate AB.

6.  Your  continued  support  of  Dick  in  his  expanded role of
    responsibility will be appreciated.

SUBJECT>   515 Restore Status


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The current status of Host 515 is as follows.  Message restoration for
1/22, the last day to restore, is currently in progress.  No major
problems have occured and barring any unforseen hurdles, the restore
should be complete sometime this evening.  A request was made to set
a system banner notifying all users to resend any messages or re-add/modify
files after 0100(PST) 1/23.  I am taking the liberty to change the time
to 0000 GMT 1/23.  The reason being that the last daily journal run for
515 was run around 1710 PST 1/22 which captures data up to 2359 GMT 1/22.

All nodes remotely involved with this problem will not to be used until
we define the source of the problem.  Post-mortum investigation will
commence on Monday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I intend on sending a complete report covering the restore and
subsequent verification of that process later today.  Briefly,
after the restore process was complete, I loaded the slot and
shut it after it answered.  I performed random checks of
restored data, both files and messages.  Then performed
functional tests - editing, filing, messaging both local and external.
The host was answered after I was satisfied that we had a good
set of databases - a copy of these is in 1st b/u shelf.  Host answered
around 0430 1/25.  The error count below is current for 515 and is
a direct result of clean-up activity while the host was shut - more
detail about the clean-up later as well.

If there are any problems or questions regarding 515, call me at
home, but if possible, late in the afternoon.

Human Resources is in the midst of an audit this week, and will not
be able to provide this information until next week, which is too late.

So, if you are interested in getting a merit review this year, the

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Current Status of Host 515 :

   After the host was brought up and interrogated, the message and
file back-up journals were run.  This procedure almost always sifts
out any unsurfaced problem with either data structure.  There was
only one file TIB collision and no message anomalies.  That in itself
is a very good sign of the validity of the restore work.  In my previous
status of 515, I mentioned quasi clean-up causing the abnormally
high system error counts.  The counts were a result of both the
system running while in a shut state, causing the interontyme errors
and cleaning up the quasi in and in-old lists which were partially
restored.  The restore code lacks some code to completely restore
quasi message lists, however, this is not desireable.  The journal
snaps the system at a single point in time.  This does not prevent
the messages from being sent to other systems, therefore, the
message in the quasi lists at the time of the journal are already at
the destination host and should not be restored to the quasi lists
at restore time as not to duplicate messages in target hosts.

   Problem determination has not identified anything yet.  Holmberg disk
utility is currently running on suspect drive 1.  No other data is
available at this time.

Respectfully,

Gary Barlow

ken, this is what i have currently, complete as it may be.



                     OPERATIONAL ACCOUNT MOVE PROCEDURE


                                 EVENT LIST





     1.0  

     Two week warning


     Inform users not to send mail to external accounts.  In  addition  the
     external accounts, where there exists a quasi for the old account, are
     informed not to send mail to the specified account.  The elapsed  time
     of  this  operation  is  dependant  on  the  time it takes to create a
     message to send.  The goal is to have empty quasi lists.





     2.0  

     Mask quasies - 15 minutes per host


     The quasi accounts on the old system, as well as the quasis on the new
     host  and neighboring hosts are masked to allow new quasis to be added
     once the physical move is complete.


     To mask a quasi requires these actions to be taken :

     1.  find and dump quasi profile on each host

     2.  patch the quasi profile with a new name - this is a debug  command
         :DEBUg patch.

     3.  Remove original quasi name from the **** host file  of  each  host
         NOTE :  The **** directory contains only interontyme host files






     3.0  

     Block account


     The account on the host is blocked to prevent  use  by  the  account's
                                                                     Page 2


     users.  This is done by using an init file to inform users the account
     is being moved, logs out active users,  and  prevents  log  in.   This
     takes 1 minute to complete.





     4.0  

     Validate


     Marketing validates an account name on the old host to  represent  the
     old  account for renaming, which is done later.  Validate is a program
     that creates an account name that doesn't already exist.  The  longest
     recorded time for this step is 36 hours.  The speed of this program is
     dependant upon the network status.


     The account's network logon is rehomed to the new host.  20 minutes.





     5.0  

     Journaling


     The files of the account to be moved are journaled.  The time it takes
     for this task is dependant upon the quantity of files for that account
     and the quantity of characters per file.  Average time is an hour.


     Take target host down and download the  single  meg  restore  program.
     This  is  about  30 minutes.  The restore program is the only software
     that reads the tape containing the previously journaled files.





     6.0  

     Move the account


     The account is validated on the new host.  This takes 5 minutes 
                                                                     Page 3


     7.0  

     Restore


     The tape is mounted on the new host  to  restore  all  the  previously
     journaled  files  for  the  new  account.   Again,  dependant upon the
     quantity and size of files, this averages an hour.





     8.0  

     Physical move is complete


     As soon as the new host is up, marketing is notified that the move  is
     complete.





     9.0  

     Rename


     If any aliases for that account exist on the old host, then they  need
     to be deleted.


     The account is renamed on the old host.  An exec file is  created  for
     that  account  to  rename  all the users of the account as well as the
     account itself.  **** shared files, acc.sup, and account  profile  are
     renamed  using  a  name  that  was previously validated.  This step is
     optional and is usually not done for large  accounts.   To  allow  the
     users  access  to  the  old  account,  validations  must  home the old
     account's (that has a different name) network logon to the  old  host.
     Since  the  acc.sup for the original account still exists on the host,
     users will not gain access until this acc.sup is removed.   This  will
     allow the newly-named-original-account-on-the-old-host's users to keep
     the same password on logon.


                                                                     Page 4


     10.0  

     Cleanup


     Two weeks after the move has taken place,  the  quasi  lists  for  the
     original  account are checked.  If they are empty, the user profile is

               *** OnTyme/Outdial Pre-Meeting Agenda ***



1.  Osiris 21.05 - the following fixes have been implemented:

     a)  UP fix
     b)  TYPE fix
     c)  Ofile - multiple access
     d)  Journal - tape trailer
     e)  Alias Add crash fix
     f)  shared file acct. removal
     g)  multiple access - multiple messages
     h)  ALL MESSAGES READ trailer

     Items c, d, and g are currently being tested; all others
     have been tested.

2.  Status of version 22?

3.  Status of RESTORE - Lois is working on the new workspace code.
    OTS is in the process of turning RESTORE over to the QA department
    for regression testing.  The next release will be passed through
    the QA department for a complete overhaul.

New Items for Discussion:

4.  What progress has been made with respect to testing plans by
    QA for RMI (Reliable Machine Interface)?  QA received documentation
    last week and is currently reviewing it.

5.  515's Fiasco - the cause is under investigation.

6.  Nucleus related slot crashes - Operations has been informed that
    the Nucleus group (Martin Shen) has been given new priorities of
    which OnTyme pulls no rank.  There are numerous crash type 11,
    14, and several type 37 and 10 which have not been investigated.
    Operations would like to request Dick Gunther to take an upperhand
    in this dilemma and work towards a higher priority for the nucleus
    with respect to OnTyme (Michael Stimac should be notified).

7.  Recovery procedures for "host" 2859 - Operations would like to
    adapt host 2859 to the existing production system procedures for
    recovery.

 Items Pending:

*  Multi-site policy and strategy statement - currently in Phase II
*  Guildelines for three digit host prefix
*  Expanded Outdial capacity

Subject: seamlessness in print 

To wit:

What do we mean when we say that we want the ACCOUNT_MOVE process to be
"seamless"?  Consider the following observations.

    o   There should never be any limitation on any user's ability to send
        mail to any other user (except as might be expected in the course
        of normal operations, and the move itself).

    o   No mail to or from a moved user should be lost or duplicated.

    o   All files associated with the moved accounts and users should be
        moved, and their order in individual directories preserved.  As
        well, the creation and access timestamps should be the same as on
        the FROM system.

    o   All message lists should be moved and the order of messages on
        these lists preserved.

    o   Each message sent on the FROM system must bear the system prefix of
        that system in its message number field.  This avoids the collision
        of message numbers of the FROM system with those on the TO system.
        Messages sent on the TO system and received on the FROM system
        should have their message identifiers converted to the local format
        when they are moved.

    o   Delivery of InterOntyme messages to a moved user will appear to
        take longer than it would have for an unmoved account; but this
        phenomenon will only be experienced during the period in which the
        InterOntyme network is reconfiguring itself.

    o   A moved user should be able to address exactly those people s/he
        could address before the move.  This means that quasis must be
        created on the TO system for every account outside the moved
        account on the FROM system, and that copies must be made on the TO
        system of each quasi on the FROM system.

    o   Aliases die hideous deaths throughout the InterOntyme network.
        Users having aliases which rely on the moved account living on the
        same system as another are the particular victims.  It is well
        known Ontyme folklore that for "X.Y/Z" to be an alias for "A.B/C",
        accounts X and A must live on the same host.  Moving X or A breaks
        this special realtionship, and there is no way of fixing the
        damage, short of asking everyone to review their aliases after the
        move has taken place.

    o   RESTORE (the program) should be able to read and restore to the TO
        system information journaled when the moved account was still on
        the FROM system.  When the move involves an inter-site transfer,
        copies of all journal tapes in existence for the FROM system may
        be required to accompany the medium containing the new account
        ins:  The
        procedure looks as bit like this:

            o   A checkpoint of the FROM system is dumped to tape before
                the ACCTMOVE command is given there.  These tapes, along
                with copies of all availible journal tapes are sent to the
                TO site.

            o   Right after the checkpoint takes place on the FROM system,
                the ACCTMOVE command is given.

            o   When the tapes arrive at the TO site, they are mapped to a
                clean disk and the account-mover conversion software is
                used to move the account to the TO system's disk.

            o   The TO system is brought up and the network reconfiguration
                proceeds.

            o   The original account information on the FROM system which
                might have been deleted by the conversion program must be
                deleted by hand or by an additional new command
                (DELETE_MOVED_ACCOUNT).

        The impact of this on the user community is that the moved
        account's users are down for a significant amount of time (at least
        2 days), and tghose trying to contact these users will see this
        delay as a postponement of response.  This may or may not be
        tolerable to them, depending on the situation.

Subject: "Gary, The recently developed crash"... 

Gary,

The recently developed crash report form which ipc.support is using
to transmit information about ontyme crashes does not have fields
for the date and time of the crash.  Without this information, it
is impossible to determine the length of time the engine was unavailable,
and hence, it is difficult to assess our reliability and availability
to customers. 

Although some operators do include this information in their free-form
comments at the end of the report, we are finding more and more crash
reports without the date and time of the crash.  Please consider adding
this to the standard information reported after a crash.

Thanks,
Steve

Steve,

You were erroneously receiving Operations' copy to us regarding outages.
The exec we use to prompt for information that was created quite some
time ago indeed does provide the date of the crash.  At this point
in time, we see no real need to provide down and up times as this
information is not pertinemt to anomaly investigation.

    scenario documentation.

3.  Assigned to DEV - Restore Software - Lois Lindley is working on the

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     The status information contained in the pre-meeting agenda and minutes
     of the OnTyme/Outdial meeting of Wednesday 1/29 require correction.
 
     In a phone conversation between Bill Frickel and Glenn Ironhat during
     December, Glenn confirmed that he had received the External documents
     for the Reliable Machine Interface in September.  Although there have
     been corrections, the essential information in those documents is
     substantially unchanged since that time.  An updated copy of the RMI
     documents was sent to QA in December.
 
     We provided the documents as early as possible on the assumption that
     they would be used to develop test strategies in parallel with our
     development effort.
 
     We are confused by QA's request for test scenario information.  In the
     past, QA has maintained and we have agreed that QA testing should be
     independent from development testing.
 
     We will provide the testing tool, including documentation, that we
     developed and have been using to simulate a front end for the machine
     interface.  This tool can be used to submit test cases for RMI.
     However the actual test scenarios should be developed independently by
     QA to assure unbiased third-party testing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     Following is a resend of a memo I sent in November regarding
immediate support.  Please cast this in stone as we cannot guarantee
100% support if this policy is not adhered to.  Thank you.

                           +++++++++

     "In efforts to ensure that we (OnTyme Support - Operations) are
reachable for a user (or system) problem necessitating immediate
attention, please note the following tip:

     Should an urgent problem arise during business hours and an
OnTyme Support person is not on the premises (of the data center),
Operations may be called at (415) 498-2588 and asked to page the
on-call for OnTyme Support."

                           +++++++++

     In addition to this the on-call can be reached at any hour
by requesting either Operations (x588) or Network Control (x5195)
to page the on-call for Ontyme Support.

                                                                Page  2

     If at any time you are unsatisfied with an Operator's analysis
of a problem you've reported, please feel free to demand that the
OnTyme Support on-call be paged.

Subject: "Gary, The time at which an OnTyme"... 

Gary,

The time at which an OnTyme node crashes,
the time at which the node returns to service,
the time the online pack copy begins and
the time the online pack copy ends 
are all very important pieces of information.

Although you are technically correct in that this information
does not aid us in our investigation of the immediate
problem, this information is crucial in a more global sense.

During the time a node is down, it is not available to our customers,
and during the pack copy, the system response is degraded.
Both our group and marketing need this statistical information to make an
informed analytical decision as to the severity of classes of problems
which we are experiencing.  This enables our three groups to set priorities
on various problems so that we address the most important issues first.

For a case in point, consider that it is not very effective to go to NTD and
say, "we've had a couple of nucleus problems -- please fix them."
We have a much better chance if we state something on the order of,
"54% of our downtime and 46% of our degraded time in the last six
weeks was due to nucleus problems.  This is our major problem
and we need your help to address it."

We have developed some tools which make it easy for us to put
this information into a data base and generate reports that will
provide us with summary information.  However, we can't do that
unless we have the data.  Alternatively, of course, operations could
track the data, but we are the group that is currently responsible
for generating status reports for the OnTyme systems.

Please reconsider the decision not to provide this data.

Thanks, 
Steve

We are currently very short on back-up systems.  I will have to
return both 2764 and 4660 to the back-up pool tomorrow afternoon.
I will be scratching any databases resident on drives at that
time.  If there is a problem with this, please contact me at
(415) 498-2501 before 1600 tomorrow.

                       PLEASE TAKE NOTE...
                               
ONTYME MARKETING (formerly in ACS), ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly 
in NTD), and FRENCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (formerly FTCC) 
have folded into the new McDonnell-Douglas Company, Electronic 
Messaging Systems, MDEMS.  All users in the aforementioned 
accounts are now part of the new OnTyme account, MDEMS.
 
Monday, January 27 is the date to remember.  Starting then, you 
must send OnTymes to the new account, MDEMS.  Any distribution 
lists which contain those users migrating to MDEMS should be 
modified to reflect the new account code as well.  
 
Both accounts, ACS and NTD will remain -- but the users now a 
part of MDEMS will no longer be valid in the 'old' accounts.  
Bear in mind though, if you are on a different host from either 
ACS or NTD, and you forget and send to an invalid userid, it 
will appear as if the message was sent.  Your host will only 
recognize that the ACCOUNT EXISTS. . .  
 
Later, in looking at your :OUT OLD list, you`ll notice that you 
now have the error message, INVALID USER next to the respective 
old userid.  It will therefore be necessary for you to resend 
your message to the correct new MDEMS userid.
 
Since the account FTCC completely folds into the MDEMS account, 
it will be removed in its entirety.  Appended below is list of 
those individuals who WERE NOT in the FTCC account.  (Just 
remember that all of FTCC will be MDEMS).  A complete directory 
can be pulled at your convenience, filed as *** DIRECT.MDEMS.

                     OPERATIONAL ACCOUNT MOVE PROCEDURE


                                 EVENT LIST





     1.0  

     Two week warning


     Inform users not to send mail to external accounts.  In  addition  the
     external accounts, where there exists a quasi for the old account, are
     informed not to send mail to the specified account.  The elapsed  time
     of  this  operation  is  dependant  on  the  time it takes to create a
     message to send.  The goal is to have empty quasi lists.





     2.0  

     Mask quasies - 15 minutes per host


     The quasis, on the old  host,  representing  the  target  account  and
     quasies  on  outside hosts, are masked to enable new quasi profiles to
     be added once the move is complete.


     To mask a quasi requires these actions to be taken :

     1.  find and dump quasi profile on each host

     2.  patch the quasi profile with a new name - this is a debug  command
         :DEBUg patch.

     3.  Remove original quasi name from the **** host file  of  each  host
         NOTE  :   The  **** host directory contains only interontyme quasi
         names



                                                                     Page 2


     3.0  

     Block account


     The account on the host is blocked to prevent  use  by  the  account's
     users.  This is done by using an init file to inform users the account
     is being moved, logs out active users,  and  prevents  log  in.   This
     takes 1 minute to complete.





     4.0  

     Validate


     Marketing validates an account name on the old host to  represent  the
     old  account for renaming, which is done later.  Validate is a program
     that creates an account name that doesn't already exist.  The  longest
     recorded time for this step is 36 hours.  The speed of this program is
     dependant upon the network status.


     The account's network logon is rehomed to the new host.  20 minutes.





     5.0  

     Journaling


     The files of the account to be moved are journaled.  The time it takes
     for this task is dependant upon the quantity of files for that account
     and the quantity of characters per file.  Average time is an hour.


     Take target host down and download the  single  meg  restore  program.
     This  is  about  30 minutes.  The restore program is the only software
     that reads the tape containing the previously journaled files.


                                                                     Page 3


     6.0  

     Move the account


     Mount the daily tape from the FROM  system  on  the  TO  system.   The
     account  is  validated  on  the  new  host  using the daily tape.  The
     Restore program has  a  validation  command  that  adds  the  acc.sup,
     account  profile,  and  all  the users to the database.  The amount of
     time for this operation is dependant upon the size of the account.



     7.0  

     Restore


     The tape is mounted on the new host  to  restore  all  the  previously
     journaled  files  for  the  new  account.   Again,  dependant upon the
     quantity and size of files, this averages an hour.





     8.0  

     Physical move is complete


     As soon as the new host is up, marketing is notified that the move  is
     complete.





     9.0  

     Rename - This  step  is  optional  and  usually  not  done  for  large
     accounts.


     If any aliases for that account exist on the old host, then they  need
     to be deleted.


     The account is renamed on the old host.  An exec file is  created  for
     that  account  to  rename  all  the users of the account.  **** shared
     files, acc.sup, and account profile are renamed using a name that  was
     previously validated.  When the old account for the rename is manually
     validated, the account contains a sup.  The  sup's  files  and  former
     account's  shared directory is manually moved into the new sup and new
     account's directory.  To allow the users access to  the  old  account,
                                                                     Page 4


     validations  must  home  the old account's (that has a different name)
     network logon to the old host.  Since the  acc.sup  for  the  original
     account  still  exists  on  the host, users will not gain access until
     this    acc.sup    is    removed.      This     will     allow     the
     newly-named-original-account-on-the-old-host's  users to keep the same
     password on logon.





     10.0  

     Cleanup


     Two weeks after the move has taken place,  the  quasi  lists  for  the
     original  account are checked.  If they are empty, the user profile is
     zerod out without disturbing the collision pointer.  The  pointers  in
     the top list/ofile blocks are also cleared.


     The account's messages are purged;  Marketing deletes the account.

Gary,

Lois believes that she will be done with 21.05 testing by 1500 today,
so at that time, I will move version 22 testing from 4660 back to 2101.
Hence, I will not need 4660 once I can load 2101, so go ahead.

Thanks for the node,

SUBJECT>   Restoration of ACS Shared Files


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Well, we finally got stung from the inability to restore multiple
volumes.  A request from ACS was received today to restore all
shared files that were accidentally deleted by an ACS Support
user who was in the process of deleting an ACS user.  During the
preparation for the evening restore activity, I reviewed the output
of last weekends' weekly file back-up.  I found what I was looking
for, unfortunately; it took two volumes to complete the back-up.
I then had to decide to either go ahead with the restore or
cook up another plan.  The address of the USER profile block for ACS was
relatively small so I figured that all of the ACS shared files would
hopefully be on the first tape.  They did start a good way from the
end of the tape, however, there are some painfully large files in the
first 5 OFILE blocks for that account which, unfortunately, hogged all
of the rest of the first tape.  I wasn't given the number of files
that were deleted but being the ACS account, I'm sure that there are
a few hundred of them.  Ultimately, since neither the Osiris EOT nor
the restore correctly handles this situation, I had Operations bring
the host up without further restore action.  I could have pursued
a few other avenues, however, without sufficient information, I
didn't want to chance really messing things up.  There are currently
45 shared files in the ACS account.  I will have to gather more
information tomorrow and reschedule the restore for tomorrow evening.
Unfortunately, CSC is in the process of changing their exec that
provides our group with the necessary information and, therefore,
didn't use any exec but hand typed the information that they had.
It seems simple, just restore the ACS shared files but other infor-
mation is still needed in case of trouble, exemplified this evening.

Sorry for any inconvenience caused by the absence of any ACS shared

files.  They will be restored tomorrow evening after I gather the
needed information.

Subject: Property Removal System 

DATE:  30 January 1986

SUBJECT:  Property Removal System

TO:    MDC-ISG San Francisco Bay Area

From:  Ron Birdsong-Manager, Security Control


1.  There have been some questions directed to the Security
Department concerning the new property removal system
controlling property that is brought in or taken out of
MDC-ISG facilities.  The following should help clarify any
further questions that arise.

    a.  GENERAL

        (1)  Any items, excluding documents, viewgraphs and
             Automatic Data Processing products, handcarried
             from company premises which are not readily
             identified as personal property of the bearer,
             or are not being removed in accordance with an
             approved control procedure, (authorized for
             movement by a properly authenticated shipping
             document) must be accompanied by an authorized
             Property Removal Pass, or removal must
             be authorized by the Security Department.

        (2)  Authorizing property to be removed by the 
             CHARGE-OUT AND REMOVAL PASS or the
             CONTINUOUS REMOVAL PASS issued to an employee
             is the responsibility of management level
             personnel.

    b.  PROPERTY REMOVAL PASSES

        (1)  There are two types of passes which are utilized
             for property movement, they are the 
             CONTINUOUS REMOVAL PASS and the CHARGE-OUT AND
             REMOVAL PASS.  The primary purpose of the passes
             is to provide a means by which an employee may
             move property from one MDC-ISG location to another
             within the Bay area.  Removal of personal property
             of an employee, vendor or visitor, not readily
             identifiable as personal property, must be
             authorized by a AND REMOVAL PASS.
             Recognizable personal property of employees,
             visitors or vendors will not require a pass.

             (a)  Continuous Removal PASS

                  -  The Continuous Removal Pass will be issued to
                     an employee who has a frequent need to move
                     specific types of property or supplies from
                     one MDC-ISG building to another within the
                     Bay area.  (NOTE:  This pass does not
                     authorize removal of the property by the
                     bearer for personal use).

                  -  Request for Continuous Removal Passes should
                     be in writing directed to the Security
                     Department giving the name of the loyee neeeding to have a new Continuous
                     Removal reissued will have to submit a new
                     written request to the Security Department.

           (b)  Charge-Out and Removal Pass

                -  The Charge-Out and Removal Pass will be issued to
                   personnel for handcarried removal of specific 
                   items of company property, and/or for removing
                   personal proprty of employees, visitors and
                   vendors that cannot readily be identified as
                   personal popety.

                -  The pass will be filled out completely and signed
                    by management level personnel prior to the
                   employee handcarrying the property.

                -  A supply of the Charge-Out and Removal Passes can
                   be obtained from the Security Department by
                   management level personnel.

                -  Each receptionist and security officer has a
                   supply of these forms for use by visitors or vendors
                   only.  All employees needing a Charge-Out and 
                   Removal Pass should contact their management level
                   personnel.

                -  When describing the MDC-ISG property on this pass
                   it is very important to include any serial numbers
                   and/or ISG tag numbers.  Failure to do so will 
                   only slow down the removal of the property as the
                   security officer or receptionist will have to
                   complete the pass with this information.

2.  Your compliance with these procedures will be appreciated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The updated copy of RMI documentation was sent to QA on JAN. 17th, not in
December as indicated.

QA has yet to be provided documentation on the use of the testing tool
developed for the testing of RMI.  It is not reasonable to expect QA to
develop test stategies.

The entire process of testing would be more efficient if all testing, both
INTEGRATION testing and REGRESSION testing was done by DEVELOPMENT where
it would be possible for the programmers to get immediate feedback and
problems would get immediate attention and the quickest resolution.

If it is desired that QA do its own testing then the testing tools that 
are developed must be made available to QA.

It would also be very helpful and timesaving if development would make
available to QA the test scenarios used during their testing phase
so that QA can analyze the extent of the testing already completed.

    Adele,

    I had a discussion with Virgil regarding dual-floppy PC-type machines,
    and his conclusion was emphatically that the AT&T machines on all
    comparable ranks are far superior to IBM's products (or any other
    lookalikes, for that matter).  This includes the dual-floppy box.

    For comparable money, the AT&T features 

                         Resulting in much faster performance:

        o   A real 8086, with 16-bit data path
        o   8 mhz clock


                              Necessary for serious use,
                          and usually requiring added boards:

        o   A full compliment of memory on the motherboard (640kb)
        o   A battery backed up time of day clock on the motherboard
        o   Serial and parallel ports on the motherboard


                                Added neatness:

        o   7 expansion slots (as opposed to IBM's 5)


    Virgil points out that the PC from IBM comes with a wimpy power supply
    which needs to be replaced if a hard disk is added and/or all 5
    expansion slots are utilized.  The 6300 has a 168 watt power supply
    capable of supporting all 7 slots and a hard disk.

    More importantly, he claims that the AT&T is cheaper to buy than the
    IBM box.  Both he and Steve Capik have looked at the engineering of the
    6300 and like it lots.  Steve owns one and loves it, Virgil wishes he
    owned one.

    I thought you might like to know this stuff, in case it ever became
    relevant.

Ken,   Bill sent me an Ontyme last night (can you beleive that). In it
       he mentioned that we are having a meeting with Stuart next
      Wednesday.   Ok fine...  he also said that  I am to have a {_list
        of projects based on account move documentation}i. To me thats not ok
        until all the loose ends ( quasis) have been identified and resolved.
        
       What do you think  ? (You may not care? )
       I'd  appreciate any thoughts you might have about loose ends that are not already in Cavins proposal ( even if they are is ok too)

       MY line is flaking out (my typing too)
talk to you soon

Subject: AT&T 6300: Another bit of hype 

    I discovered this after mailing the last entry, and thought it might
    merit inclusion in a sales presentation.  It seems that the video card
    which comes with the monochrome version is a color graphics card, kind
    of like what Compaq does, although it seems that Compaq's card is
    superior to the extent that they designed it to tolerate software
    dumping (text) to video ram willy-nilly, whereas virtually everyone
    else, including the 6300, sort of relies on the offending software
    following the proper horizontal and vertical retrace protocol.

completely deleted (OSP),(OSB) and a few more, removed CTMKTG1 and
CTMKTG7 from the system, and trimmed as much as I could find out of

REG: ACCOUNT MOVE SHORT TERM HIGH PAYOFF ENHANCEMENTS

1)   Ken should also attend this meeting as he is as knowledgeable as i am
     on account moves.

2)   Before i propose possible account moves fixes, everyone involved should
     agree on a standard account move procedure. I have spent a great deal of
     time working on an event list based on specific account move procedures
     (PMTS and FSC ACCOUNTS). 

     For evereyone to agree on the account move list, there should not be
     any loose ends ( i.e. a decision has to be made regarding the qausis,
     representing external accounts so that users of the account to be moved
     cannot havee their out list processed prior to a move. Of course, there
     are other alternatives which have to be considered which may be better
     for this item).

     In order to have decisions made on the "loose ends", they have to be 
     identified, this requires everyone's expertise and suggestions. As
     of this writing that i know of, the questions asked in cavin's
     document "account move proposal" still have to be answered.

3)   Any recommemdations that i may have cannot be made hastily to appease 
     any individual or group of individuals, they should be made with the
     group's ideas as input, as a first phase of development consisting 
     of a list of tasks, short term and long term, to form a basis for the 
     final solution ( the last development phase). This will save time 
      and money in the long run, and prevent the duplication of tasks to 
     achieve the same result.

4)   Any additions, thoughts,comments, complaints will be considered.

TO SUMMARIZE :  In order to suggest short term high payoff items,
     the following has to be done 

                  a) all "loose ends" have to be identified and decided upon.

                  b) everyone has to agree on a standard account move procedur

                  c) any work that is done has to be the foundation for the
                     whole project.

LASTly - I would appreciate it greatly if everyone reviewed my account move
           list and cavin's account move proposal.



                     OPERATIONAL ACCOUNT MOVE PROCEDURE


                                 EVENT LIST





     1.0  

     Two week warning


     Inform users not to send mail to external accounts.  In  addition  the
     external accounts, where there exists a quasi for the old account, are
     informed not to send mail to the specified account.  The elapsed  time
     of  this  operation  is  dependant  on  the  time it takes to create a
     message to send.  The goal is to have empty quasi lists.





     2.0  

     Mask quasies - 15 minutes per host


     The quasis, on the old  host,  representing  the  target  account  and
     quasies  on  outside hosts, are masked to enable new quasi profiles to
     be added once the move is complete.


     To mask a quasi requires these actions to be taken :

     1.  find and dump quasi profile on each host

     2.  patch the quasi profile with a new name - this is a debug  command
         :DEBUg patch.

     3.  Remove original quasi name from the **** host file  of  each  host
         NOTE  :   The  **** host directory contains only interontyme quasi
         names



                                                                     Page 2


     3.0  

     Block account


     The account on the host is blocked to prevent  use  by  the  account's
     users.  This is done by using an init file to inform users the account
     is being moved, logs out active users,  and  prevents  log  in.   This
     takes 1 minute to complete.





     4.0  

     Validate


     Marketing validates an account name on the old host to  represent  the
     old  account for renaming, which is done later.  Validate is a program
     that creates an account name that doesn't already exist.  The  longest
     recorded time for this step is 36 hours.  The speed of this program is
     dependant upon the network status.


     The account's network logon is rehomed to the new host.  20 minutes.





     5.0  

     Journaling


     The files of the account to be moved are journaled.  The time it takes
     for this task is dependant upon the quantity of files for that account
     and the quantity of characters per file.  Average time is an hour.


     Take target host down and download the  single  meg  restore  program.
     This  is  about  30 minutes.  The restore program is the only software
     that reads the tape containing the previously journaled files.


                                                                     Page 3


     6.0  

     Move the account


     Mount the daily tape from the FROM  system  on  the  TO  system.   The
     account  is  validated  on  the  new  host  using the daily tape.  The
     Restore program has  a  validation  command  that  adds  the  acc.sup,
     account  profile,  and  all  the users to the database.  The amount of
     time for this operation is dependant upon the size of the account.



     7.0  

     Restore


     The tape is mounted on the new host  to  restore  all  the  previously
     journaled  files  for  the  new  account.   Again,  dependant upon the
     quantity and size of files, this averages an hour.





     8.0  

     Physical move is complete


     As soon as the new host is up, marketing is notified that the move  is
     complete.





     9.0  

     Rename - This  step  is  optional  and  usually  not  done  for  large
     accounts.


     If any aliases for that account exist on the old host, then they  need
     to be deleted.


     The account is renamed on the old host.  An exec file is  created  for
     that  account  to  rename  all  the users of the account.  **** shared
     files, acc.sup, and account profile are renamed using a name that  was
     previously validated.  When the old account for the rename is manually
     validated, the account contains a sup.  The  sup's  files  and  former
     account's  shared directory is manually moved into the new sup and new
     account's directory.  To allow the users access to  the  old  account,
                                                                     Page 4


     validations  must  home  the old account's (that has a different name)
     network logon to the old host.  Since the  acc.sup  for  the  original
     account  still  exists  on  the host, users will not gain access until
     this    acc.sup    is    removed.      This     will     allow     the
     newly-named-original-account-on-the-old-host's  users to keep the same
     password on logon.





     10.0  

     Cleanup


     Two weeks after the move has taken place,  the  quasi  lists  for  the
     original  account are checked.  If they are empty, the user profile is
     zerod out without disturbing the collision pointer.  The  pointers  in
     the top list/ofile blocks are also cleared.


     The account's messages are purged;  Marketing deletes the account.

Subject: getlch and aux ckts 

    First, sorry for getting weird on the phone yesterday.  Please allow me
    to take this opportunity to get weird through the mail:

    My copy of the YAMM, corroborated by (sailib)uuosym.def, says that the
    line characteristics bit indicating auxckt-ness is "1b12".  I wrote a
    little test program which basically does

        seto    1, ;
        ttcall  6, 1;

    and prints the result.  I proceeded to run this program (TST on my
    directory on :930) both when logged in directly and when logged in via
    TAUX from an alien system.  The results were:

        [000040,,000000]        1b12
        [123321,,000014]        Direct login
        [101321,,000015]        TAUX   login

    Note that lc.axc (1b12) is unaffected.  I must be doing something
    wrong.  I know that LOADII kicks your butt if it sees you logged in
    under an auxckt. I wonder how it knows...

    /Ken

Subject: AUX CIRCUIT-ness 

GETLCH bits may or may not reflect reality.  I doubt that anyone has
looked at those in years.  The YAMM is also a bit out of date (no pun
[bit] intended) as under .GTLOG it is documented to use the 1000 bit
of the node number to determine if it's AUX or not... That was based
on the "fact" that all bases were node numbers less than 1000 and all
TYMSATs started at 1000.  When TYMNET-II came about with node numbers
starting at 2000, that story went out the window.  The "real" test of
aux-circuit-ness is to look at the TID byte of .GTLOG/UPTLOG and a 0
value means we have an aux circuit.  (One exception: If the entire
node field of .GTLOG is 0, we are on a PTY and all bets are off).

When I get time, I'll take a look at what sets lc.axc and we'll see if
we can mae it do someting reasonable... sigh.

PS: OK about weirdness... everything seems to be going that way of late.

Re:  Ontyme support software status report  Jan 13 -- Feb 9  86

The first item on the report indicates a problem with 832 displaying
the incorrect nucleus version number occasionally.

This is NOT the reason that dumps were provided.  As indicated in the slot
crash report mail, there was a process which was looping in a GOTO
routine with no associated user logged on.  This was the reason for
the dumps and this problem still needs to be investigated.

Regarding the display of the incorrect nucleus version....  It was not
displayed occasionally but was diplayed consistently depending on 
which ontyme user port the user was logged onto.

Subject: "Abnormal" Slot Processes on Host 7150 

To:  Amy Lee (@Mdems.Support)
From:  Jeannine Ortiz
Re:  "Abnormal" Slot Processes on Host 7150

Since January 17th, there have not been more than 22
simultaneous users on host 7150 at any given time.
We have received reports of slow response time within
the last week on this host.  

Interrogation of the slot uncovered the following:


1.  CPU usage at 93% with a 7 user port load - this is 
    unusual considering the light user load and the fact
    that the disk activity was light.  When the slot is
    idling with a light user load, the CPU is usually
    in the 40-60% range.

2.  Processes 46-51 were in the following state (I also
    checked them while the slot was frozen):

    state=IO  priority=3 addr=28B3C in procedure ???

I do not know whether items 1 and 2 are related, but
would appreciate your investigating the second item
at your earliest convenience.  I am having the slot 
restarted at 8 pm tonight.  You are welcome to log 
into the slot (kernel host #2165) any time prior to
that if you'd like to poke around in the code.

The dump files are as follows:

INF     - (slotdump:36)d71501.043
LOADII  - (slotdump:36)h71501.043
NIB     - (jortiz:36)hs7150.n01

   LEGEND: DEV - MDEMS Development Group, SDI - Software Distribution
           and Installation, FSC - Field Service Company (h/w maintenance),    
           OTS - OnTyme Support (Computer Operations - IPC), HSS - Hardware   
           Systems Support, QA - Quality Assurance (Computer Operations - IPC)
           WNFE - Western Network Field Engineering, MKT - MDEMS Marketing  
           Support Group




1.  Assigned to DEV/QA - This pass of 21.05 was returned to DEV due to an
    increase in File Chain breaks.  A temporary fix - retry on the 1st
    error - increased the number of broken file pointers, therefore, the
    code was returned.  QA will continue on other, non-related areas of code.

2.  Assigned to DEV - Osiris 22.00 is in the DEV Integrated testing phase.
    The tentative release date to Betatest is mid March.  This code will
    contain a switch enabling the use of the new Subject Line List format
    on an account wide basis.

3.  Assigned to QA/DEV - Restore 2.01 - 2.01 will be released without the
    workspace changes.  2.02 will contain the multi-volume fix and
    3.0 will incorporate all of the workspace and MAT Chain additions.
    The QA group is reviewing 2.01 before its release.

4.  Assigned to MKT/NTD - Escalation of Nucleus crashes.  Martin is now
    reviewing some of the Nucleus crashes and has nothing to report at
    this time.  The new Nucleus being used by the DEV group for
    Osiris 22.00 will have to be "blessed" by the Languages Group prior
    its release.

5.  Assigned to DEV - Status of Inter-Ontyme move issue.  It was proposed
    that those involved with this project from the DEV group arrange to
    attend a "walk-thru" of a pseudo account move to resolve any mis-
    understandings of the move's time frame or procedures.  This should
    be coordinated between the DEV group and the Support group.

6.  Assigned to Support - New node billing.  Mat Russo  and Les Metour
    will be added to the GCF that is sent when new nodes are to be
    considered billable.  That is after the nodes have been burned in
    by Support and fully tested.  A report will be sent to MKT providing
    Support's best guess as to when the new engines will be considered
    billable.

7.  Assigned to MKT - Mat Russo is in charge of moving the DEV lab to
    Fremont.  No other status on this issue at this time.

8.  Assigned to Support/DEV - Possible Support of Holmberg (Disk Exerciser)
    code.  When and if the source code is located, the DEV group will
    determine whether they will be able to support the requested changes.
    The author or his cohorts will have to be contacted to locate it.

9.  Assigned to MKT - Discussion of the scope of the Product Control Board.
    A brief description of the PCB was presented but a complete description
    will be provided at the next meeting.  It deals mainly with discussion
    and prioritization of requests for changes or additions to the Ontyme
    product.

    What you said is really true.  Thanks for you help.  It just seems that
    I remember you speaking about certain 12-bit node numbers which were
    soon going to become 14-bit node numbers.  Could the two 6-bit parts in
    the .gtlog word be what you were referring to?  As I recall, the whole
    14-bits was going to become a single field.

Ken,

      I've been modifying my PEAK.INI, and trying to include a string on the
message line.  File PEAK.KEY says that an "extended meta" key (^X ") preceding
the string, and ending the string with a double-quote sign, will place the
string on the message line.  I have tried that in my PEAK.INI, with nothing
happening.  I even tried putting it after the 'clear file lock' (^X +),
without success.  If you have any interest in looking directly at it, this
PEAK.INI has been Telecopied to almost all PDP-10s.

      I know, I'm supposed to be the one supporting this software.  I'd like
your help in getting my use of this feature straight:  the problem may only be
my misuse of it.

      Thanks!!
      Dennis

    Dennis,

    My guess is that you are trying to cause the message line to change at
    different points in the execution of the PEAK.INI file.  If this is
    true, I think you are being thwarted by the fact that PEAk will not
    display the firts screen until after PEAK.INI is through.  I was going
    to suggest that ^X^L [Command File] might work, but I tried it, and it
    seems that the command finishes by putting up a message, which
    overwrites any you may have created.

    Th only thing I've used this message line facility for is to finish off
    a macro with a little message (this is helpful for overwriting the last
    message put up by the macro with something more sensible).  The macro
    in question CAN be defined in PEAK.INI.  To wit:

        ^Xd/foo^x"this is a foo"/^Xm\

    This utterance will create a macro bound to backslash which inserts
    "foo" into the buffer and puts the message "this is a foo" on the
    message line.

    Hope this helps.

    I just got (and replied to) a message from Dennis Coffey regarding some
    detail of PEAK usage.  in his message, he mentioned that he is supposed
    to be supporting PEAK, sort of in an offhand manner.  I'm wondering if
    there might be trouble brewing with respect to yours truly, or am I
    being paranoid?

 Refer : MSG# A19405 from Glenn Ironhat
         regarding OnTyme Support status report


     1) Item 1 on OnTyme Support Software Status Report
        Jan 13 -- Feb 9 86 is not the problem Glenn was
        talking about in MSG#A19405.
        I was informed of the nucleus version problem in
        the MSG# A98734 sent by Glenn and no dump files
        were provided. And there were no dump files on 
        item one.

     2) The problem Glenn talked about in MSG# A19405
        was item 3 in the support report. This problem
        was reported in MSG#A00087 and MSG#A00965.
        The information and status of the problem is
        the above item in the support report.

     3) Since the incorrect nucleus version number was not
        displayed "occasionally" ( 'occasionally' was
        reported by Glenn in MSG# A98734.) but "consistently
        depending on which OnTyme user port the user was
        logged onto", providing this information when the 
        problem happens again would be necessary for debugging
        the problem.

     4) If there is any question about this, please Ontyme me.

I think that "officially" our group is supporting PEAK.  Dennis doesn't
really even know SAIL, let alone support a complex program like PEAK.  He
may have just been giving the "party"-line about what our group is still
responsible for supporting.  Your support of PEAK is sort of ERSATZ if you
know what I mean.  Don't worry about it...

To : Bill,Stuart
Fr : larry
Re : fixes


After talking with operations, it seems that our emphasis should be 
placed upon restoring external messages to the user outlists. That
is the bulk of their problems with the account move. The short terms
we thought of are in the right direction to make the procedure less
complex but the short terms we develop should answer their immediate
needs. 

1) Currently the restore program cannot restore external messages to the 
   account's user's out lists. This should be a fix that would involve
   alterating the message header record.

2) The capability of toggling Interontyme at the account level would greatly
   increase the ease of the account move by turning off IOT to allow the
   move to take place.
The above items should be ranked as the most important followed by our items
ranked as the most helpful.

3) NCB to reconstruct IOT connections
4) Limited access to old account
5) Removal of account and its messages and files

          ALL ISG EMPLOYEES


          CHANGE IN TAX LAWS - TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS





    McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (ISG) employees 
attending a college, university or other reimbursable program 
under the ISG Tuition Reimbursement benefit should be aware of a 
change in the tax law concerning tuition reimbursements.

    Code Section 127 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 
1978 and excluded tuition reimbursements from gross income.  This 
section of the Code expired on December 31, 1985 and unless a new 
Code amendment is passed or the present one extended, tuition 
reimbursements will be included in gross income and subject to tax 
withholdings beginning January 1, 1986.  As a result, tuition 
reimbursements paid to employees after January 1, 1986 will 
reflect the withholding of the appropriate amount as required by 
the law.

    There is an indication that Congress may act in early 1986 to 
reinstate the provisions of section 127.  If that occurs, ISG will 
make appropriate refunds to the affected employees.

Subject: "In working on the documentation"... 

In working on the documentation for RESTORE, I did a comparison of the
commands in RESTORE and ONTYME.  Both use the command BUILD.  It is
used for building circuits in ONTYME, and for building system files in
RESTORE.

This seems to add an unnecessary layer of confusion on RESTORE.  I
suppose the RESTORE command is the one that should change since it
affects only the operations staff.  

Comments, suggestions welcome.  Changes in RESTORE would be in version
3.0 which will include updating the workspace operations.

1)  The slot dump files indicated in Item #3 of the status report belong
to Item #1 not Item #3.  This was indicated in the slot crash mail #A00965 sent
on Jan 15.  The slot crash report states that a dump was taken because of a
hung process.  It is stated that process #23 was looping in a GOTO routine.

Item # 3 in the support status report refers to process # 16 in a HALT
state.  Clearly this refers to a different problem.  The dump files of the
15th were taken while the system was up and running.  The problem described
as item #3 in the report, is a problem which caused the slot to crash.

Msg #A00965 is the crash report regarding the hung process #23 and the 
associated dump files H08321.015 and D08321.015.

Msg #A00087 refers to another software problem occurring the next
day.  In this case, there were no dump files provided.

2)  Message #A98734 reports the problem of the incorrect nucleus version 
number to the development group.  This was sent on Jan 13.  A follow up
ontyme #A01866 was sent on Jan 16.  This states that the incorrect nucleus
version number was displayed consistantly depending on the user port occupied.
This ontyme also reports process #23 looping in a GOTO routine.  This ontyme
also references the same slot dump file as indicated in the slot crash report
mail #A00965.

In actuality, the dump files are dumps of a hung process #23 AND dumps of the
system in a state where USER ports 5,7, and 8 reported the wrong nucleus
version number.

    Of course you wouldn't be here.  I brought in some vi documentation
    which includes a tiny cheat sheet.  I'll be babysitting appliances
    tomorrow am, so look on my desk.  One document is velo-bound and should
    really remain that way, but the stuff in the envelope seems to be
    loose.  The top of the stack in the envelope is the laser-printer
    output I got for the Ex and Vi quick reference cards when I was at NTD
    doing Martin Shen's job.  Read them and weep..

    See you when I do.

   LEGEND: DEV - MDEMS Development Group, SDI - Software Distribution
           and Installation, FSC - Field Service Company (h/w maintenance),    
           OTS - OnTyme Support (Computer Operations - IPC), HSS - Hardware   
           Systems Support, QA - Quality Assurance (Computer Operations - IPC)
           WNFE - Western Network Field Engineering, MKT - MDEMS Marketing  
           Support Group




1.  Assigned to DEV - When clearing files in a "folder.filename" the
    command is aborted with an "ofile" error on the last ".filename" in
    that block; a fix for this is in the works.  DEV has fixed the
    logon loop and "match" command bugs.  The pack copy fix has been
    written but will take two more days to test.  If the installation 
    and testing of this fix doesn't prolong the release of 21.05 it
    may be included in this version.

2.  Assigned to DEV - Os
    compatibility mode switch is underway; target release date is the
    end of march (this date does not include the release of a
    compatible nucleus code).

3.  Assigned to DEV - Nucleus for Osiris 22.00 - Stuart has written some
    Nucleus code which is being used to test Osiris 22.00.  NTD's Languages
    Group must accept this code in order to officially release it.  This
    nucleus, however, currently supports only 4 aux circuits; OnTyme's
    current configuration requires at least 24 aux circuits to support
    InterOnTyme, Outdial and the NCB.

4.  Assigned to DEV - Multiple Volume Restore and Workspace Fixes - DEV
    is currently testing multiple volume code amidst a juggling of resources.
    As stands, DEV is developing a means to get around the end-of-tape
    milestone and an estimate for this code's release was not available.




                                                                    Page 2



5.  Assigned to DEV - Lower Authorization for EXEC Execution - The Army Corps
    of Engineers must grant their users an undesired authorization level of
    four to simply enable the use of exec menus.  Since this requires a
    small change to the OnTyme code, every OnTyme system will be set up
    likewise.  Since this may not be desired, DEV will investigate this
    matter and possible alternatives for MKT's review (it is a minor change,
    but the impact to other user communities must be analyzed).  This change
    might be incorporated into version 21.05.

6.  Assigned to OTS - Public Bulletin Announcement File - OTS will be
    creating a public file on all internal engines which will be set on
    each internal host as a system-wide banner indicating the filename(s)
    of public announcements.  This procedure will be introduced in a few
    weeks on a trial basis; rather than each account's supervisor sending
    the bulletins to all the account's users, MKT will use this banner to
    inform us of the latest bulletins.  MKT has proposed this effort to
    provide timely distribution of important bulletins.

7.  Assigned to QA - Nucleus Patch File - QA has written a patch file for
    the nucleus which will compute the cylinder, track and head for each
    disk error generated by the system.  This additional information will
    aid in the investigation of disk problems encountered on the test (backup)
    engines.  QA has submitted an NSR to NTD to include this patch.

Subject: Frustrated Online Pack Copy bug fix 


                  Does Ontyme really know its disk units?

I modified the Online Pack Copy command logic in UTLCMD.OSI to include a
test of the availabilty of both logical units.  This was in order to
prevent a pack copy operation from being initiated if one of the units
involved is not in READ/WRITE state.

The code I added mimicked the "DISPLAY VOLUME" command logic in performing
a "dsksys.disk_info()" call and checking the "options" field of each unit
entry for a value of "1" (advertised to mean READ/WRITE status).

The tests I performed today, and the results I got were as follows:

    o   I logged into OSIRIS:815, userid SUP.SUP.

    o   I put unit D0 into READ ONLY state by flipping the switch on the
        disk drive unit itself.

    o   I issued the command :COPY D0 D1.  In response, the following was
        printed:

            COPY FROM UNIT 00000000 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000

            TOTAL PAGES= 000C7236

        and the "SELECT" light on D0 flickered for one or two minutes,
        apparently as the unit was being read.  After this delay, the
        following was printed:

            DISK ERROR
            COPY ABORTED!!

        (I had anticipated that my error message "FROM UNIT NOT READY"
        would be displayed and the copy operation not even attempted.)

    o   I attempted to try to guess what I should say to get some status
        information, issuing a number of commands which did no disk
        writing, and then I issued the "LOGOUT" command.

        The response was 

            please log in:

        a sure sign that Ontyme had crashed.  Later investigation showed
        that the reason for the crash was "DataBase Offline-FAIL 99"

    o   After switching D0 back to READ/WRITE state, I executed the slot
        using the DDT "E" command and found the system up and happy.

    o   I logged in to :815 again as SUP.SUP and issued the "DISPLAY
        VOLUME" command.  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

    o   I then switched D0 into READ ONLY state and repeated the "DISPLAY
        VOLUME". The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

        Ten seconds or so later, I repeated the command, and received the
        response:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   DOWN
              1   0   RW


    o   After switching the drive back to READ/WRITE state, all succeeding
        "DISPLAY VOLUME" commands showed the unit to be DOWN.  Attempts to
        FILE large files did not cause the "SELECT" light on D0 to flicker.

        This seemed to indicate that once the nucleus has decided the unit
        is down, there is no way to change that state, short of
        re-executing the slot.


Right now, it seems that the only way to tell if a drive is "DOWN" is to
try to write to it.  That's ok, but it also seems that once a drive is
found to be "DOWN", it can never be returned to READ/WRITE status.

Note that the result of the "dsksys.disk_info()" call did not accurately
reflect the fact that the drive was in READ ONLY state.  My guess is that
either the nucleus does not really understand the disk controller in a
number of ways, or the disk controller is giving erroneous information..

Subject: PEAK and detach-and-continue-running mode 

    Here's a curious phenomenon:  Several times Lois and I have observed
    detached frames running PEAK in RN state, and on those occasions we
    have wondered at what might be happening to cause said state to be
    induced, since PEAK blocks for input most of the time.  Also several
    times, my colleague Steve Schramm, through treachery on the high
    BUBBNET seas, has wound up with frames in just such a condition.

    Steve asked me today what to do with such a frame, and i advised him to
    attach-escape-continue-and-^L (the off-the-shelf remedy for this type
    of problem).  He said "Oh, but last time i did that I got a bunch of
    's's."  I said, "let me watch."

    We went through the Right Procedure, and lo-and-behold:  gobs and gobs
    of lowercase 's's!!!  It look as if PEAK doesn't know that the command
    port has gone away and somehow gets a continuous stream of characters
    from the port.

    I have the more reasonable "logout-after-timeout" option set, and i've
    never had any problem with crap in an edit that i continued. Any
    insights?

RE:      CAN'T DISPLAY QUASI


THE "M" ACCOUNT IS ON HOST 515.  A QUASI (QUASI M) HAS BEEN
ADDED TO HOST 7153.  WHEN THE COMMAND "QUASI M" IS ENTERED,
THE ERROR MESSAGE "KEYWORD IS NOT RECOGNIZED--TRY AGAIN"
OUTPUTS.  THE ERROR MESSAGE AND FACT THAT THE QUASI CAN BE
DISPLAYED BY USING "QUASI ALL 515" INDICATES THAT "M" IS
TAKEN FOR PART OF A SYSTEM KEYWORD (WHICH ONE, I'M NOT
CERTAIN).

THE ACCOUNT ITSELF (ON 515) CAN BE DISPLAYED WITH THE DISPLAY
ACCOUNT COMMAND AND I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEM SENDING
A TEST MESSAGE TO "M.SUP", SO IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE KEYWORD
PROBLEM ONLY EXISTS WITH THE "QUASI M" COMMAND.

If you get in on time and wish to attend, there is a demo of an encryption
product in the training room today at 1:30.  (I'll be attending)  It may be
the same company as the one you attended before -- but I think there will
be more opportunity for technical interaction.  At least that's what I
know so far -- information sketchy.  At any rate, I'll see you then if you
can come, else afterwards.

Subject: SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS's 

Actually, when the port got "zapped" it really was the node going out-to-lunch
and it seems that when the node does that we see lots of S's or s's sent to the
line.  I had this happen to me the other night... my job kept hanging...
well, the job wasn't hung... TYMNET sent tons of S's to my job, and of course
this keeps the redisplay busy enough that the terminal appeared to be hung.

Anyway, this phenomonon (sp?) has occurred a lot lately.  Also, there seems
to be a lot of times when the nodes seem to "stop" transmitting and merely
breaking the circuit and re-attaching is the only solution.  *sigh*

I don't think PEAK is at fault...  I've seen it happen too much lately, and
as you know, I only use PEAK for aux-circuits and editing my TUMS msgs.  It
happens to me using VUE...

Ciao... /Carl

PS:  I started to send this message last night at 11:25  and  after 6 or 8
     tries which kept hanging up, I gave up and left the jobs detached.  It
     seems to be working OK at the moment.

Apparently, when NTD was told that they had to pay maintenance on 897,
which previously was paid by AUGMENT, they balked and said turn it off.
So,  897 is no more.

Did you lose anything?  It might be retrievable, but I donno...I'll have
to check with BLDG-A operations... i.e. did they do an all-files prior to
it's de-commission, and if so, can the tapes be loaded elsewhere.

I won't check, unless you lost something.  sigh.

Subject: Frustrated Online Pack Copy bug fix 


                  Does Ontyme really know its disk units?

I modified the Online Pack Copy command logic in UTLCMD.OSI to include a
test of the availabilty of both logical units.  This was in order to
prevent a pack copy operation from being initiated if one of the units
involved is not in READ/WRITE state.

The code I added mimicked the "DISPLAY VOLUME" command logic in performing
a "dsksys.disk_info()" call and checking the "options" field of each unit
entry for a value of "1" (advertised to mean READ/WRITE status).

The tests I performed today, and the results I got were as follows:

    o   I logged into OSIRIS:815, userid SUP.SUP.

    o   I put unit D0 into READ ONLY state by flipping the switch on the
        disk drive unit itself.

    o   I issued the command :COPY D0 D1.  In response, the following was
        printed:

            COPY FROM UNIT 00000000 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
                  TO  UNIT 00000001 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
            TOTAL PAGES= 000C7236

        and the "SELECT" light on D0 flickered for one or two minutes,
        apparently as the unit was being read.  After this delay, the
        following was printed:

            DISK ERROR
            COPY ABORTED!!

        (I had anticipated that my error message "FROM UNIT NOT READY"
        would be displayed and the copy operation not even attempted.)

    o   I attempted to try to guess what I should say to get some status
        information, issuing a number of commands which did no disk
        writing, and then I issued the "LOGOUT" command.

        The response was 

            please log in:

        a sure sign that Ontyme had crashed.  Later investigation showed
        that the reason for the crash was "DataBase Offline-FAIL 99"

    o   After switching D0 back to READ/WRITE state, I executed the slot
        using the DDT "E" command and found the system up and happy.

    o   I logged in to :815 again as SUP.SUP and issued the "DISPLAY
        VOLUME" command. SPLAsponse wT VOL 0   RW
RW

 o latd, 
                 hing the dITE stLUME" commands showed the unit to be DOWN.  Attempts to
        FILE large files did not cause the "SELECT" light on D0 to flicker.

        This seemed to indicate that once the nucleus has decided the unit
        is down, there is no way to change that state, short of
        re-executing the slot.


Right now, it seems that the only way to tell if a drive is "DOWN" is to
try to write to it.  That's ok, but it also seems that once a drive is
found to be "DOWN", it can never be returned to READ/WRITE status.

Note that the result of the "dsksys.disk_info()" call did not accurately
reflect the fact that the drive was in READ ONLY state.  My guess is that
either the nucleus does not really understand the disk controller in a
number of ways, or the disk controller is giving erroneous information..

     ========================================================================
     The Monthly Newsletter of the APPLIED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS COMPANY
     from ACS MARKETING PUBLICATIONS, Cupertino, CA . . . February 22, 1985
     ========================================================================
     
                     THE COMPETITION DISAPPEARS, REORGANIZES
     
     Two significant  competition moves  occurred this month:  AT&T abandoned
     NET 1000, and GTE SPRINT and U.S. TELECOM merged in joint venture.
     
     "ACS always  knew AT&T  was not a significant threat," says ACS Business
     Development Manager  Nancy Browning.  "ACS always succeeded at what AT&T
     failed to  do--the Ford  and IDP  applications are  examples.  [Both are
     forthcoming Success  Stories.    See  the  "ACS  Publications"  column.]
     However, our  clients were originally impressed with AT&T's presence and
     backing.   They had a large `share of mind' in the marketplace, and with
     that, they had the client's ear."
     
     If you  have lost  business to AT&T, or if AT&T was close to any of your
     prospects, call them now.  Those clients need a new vendor.
     
     "The SPRINT  and U.S.  TELECOM situation  was primarily  driven  by  the
     desirable merger  of two  long distance  telephone units,"  says  Nancy.
     "However, TELENET and UNINET are part of the deal.  Tymnet predicts that
     TELENET/UNINET will  take advantage of significant economies of scale by
     disassembling their  respective `backbones' and migrating the traffic to
     the new SPRINT/U.S. TELECOM backbone."
     
     In the  meantime, reorganization  and confusion  should  present  strong
     short-term sales opportunities for McDonnell Douglas.  The competition's
     sales and  support activities  will probably be disrupted as people move
     around and try to figure out who they work for.
     
     "If you  are  speaking  with  a  client  or  prospect  who  uses  or  is
     considering TELENET  or UNINET,"  says Nancy,  "be sure to emphasize the
     risks inherent in working with an unstable organization and to highlight
     McDonnell Douglas' focus and commitment."
     
     
                            NEW ONTYME PRODUCT MANAGER
     
     Tom Olt  has been  named the OnTyme Product Manager for ACS.  Tom brings
     over 10  years of marketing experience to this position.  Most recently,
     he worked in the Strategic Marketing Development group.
     
     As product  manager, Tom  will be working with your local consultants on
     providing nonstandard  pricing  information,  and  he  will  act  as  an
     interface to  the MDC  legal department when contracts are written.  Tom
     is also  part of a team that is developing a lead handling procOne of  his first  goals is to develop a list of enhancements to be made like to discuss enhancements

     the company  and its  services,  and  includes  a  diagram  showing  the
     components of  a typical  applied communications  system, and three case
     studies.   The case  studies demonstrate  how  we  met  the  information

     The competition  keeps getting  tougher.    If  we  don't  increase  our
     productivity we'll  get beaten by the competition.  This is true for our
     country, our company, and individual business deals.
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     This requires  us not only to work hard but also to work smart.  Working
     smart means  leveraging the  resources of the company.  It means getting

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, ENROLLMENT IN TYMNET TRAINING AND EDUCATION
COURSES FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 1986 IS NOT AS HIGH AS PROJECTED LAST OCTOBER.
THEREFORE, WE ARE MODIFYING THE SCHEDULE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER.  THIS
MODIFICATION PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

    A)  CLASS SIZE WILL BE LARGER WHICH MAKES TRAINING MORE EFFICIENT.
    B)  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CANCEL CLASSES.
    C)  TTE WILL BE ABLE TO DESIGN AND DELIVER MORE CUSTOMIZED COURSES
        FOR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS.
 
THE DISADVANTAGE OF THIS REVISION IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED
IN CLASSES THAT ARE NO LONGER ON THE SCHEDULE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE PLANS.
WE REGRET THIS INCONVIENCE AND WILL DO OUR BEST TO RESCHEDULE YOU FOR AN
ACCEPTABLE TIME.  CHERYL MCGOWAN, TTE REGISTRAR, WILL CONTACT YOU TO
RESCHEDULE.
 
***  SPECIAL NOTE TO SALES REPS - PLEASE INFORM YOUR CUSTOMERS OF THIS
     REVISIOIN.
 
THE PRINTED SCHEDULE AVAILABLE FROM SUSAN COPELAND WILL BE CHANGED BUT
THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS.  MOST CLASSES FOR WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE
CURRENTLY REGISTERED WERE NOT CHANGED.  PROPOSALS FOR CUSTOMER-SITE
CLASSES ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS REVISION. ***

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  dical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

SUBJECT:   Parking Lots at Valley Green

From:      Ron Birdsong - Manager, Security Control


On Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 9 March 1986 the parking lots
at 20605 and 20705 Valley Green (VG1, VG2 and VG3) will be
resurfaced and striped.  Those employees needing access to
these facilities should park on the south side of VG2 and
the west side of VG1 and VG2 adjacent to the lobby entrance.
All employees entering VG1 and VG2 can do so through the
front lobby entrance.  This entrance will be open 24 hours
a day during this weekend as well as the lobby to VG3.
All employees should have their vehicles moved to the
appropriate spaces no later than 5:00 AM on 8 March 1986.
Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Subject: lvol nucleus bug? 

    Martin,

    Please help me.  I need to know what (if anything) is going wrong
    with my use of the nucleus with regard to determining the state of
    the logical disk volumes we are using in Ontyme.

    I recently added some code to the online pack copy logic in Ontyme
    to insure that both logical volumes involved in the transfre are
    in R/W state before allowing the copy operation to be initiated.
    The io call to the nucleus used was

        io(data, parm, lvol, 0);

    where

        parm.operation := lvol_info;

    and my tests of this indicated that the information returned in
    the "options" field of the information record did not accurately
    reflect the actual state of the drive in question. In particular,
    I switched the "from" drive into Read-Only state and found that my
    lvol_info request indicated that the drive was in R/W state.

    Enclosed is a copy of the memo I wrote after doing my tests,
    detailing what I did.  What I would like to know is how to
    reliably tell the state of the logical volumes without causing
    them to go into a state which cannot be changed without
    re-executing the slot.

    Thanks for your consideration,
    
    Ken Dawson (mdems.k/dawson),
    Ontyme Development
                   Does Ontyme really know its disk units?

        I modified the Online Pack Copy command logic in UTLCMD.OSI to
        include a test of the availabilty of both logical units.  This
        was in order to prevent a pack copy operation from being
        initiated if one of the units involved is not in READ/WRITE
        state.

        The code I added mimicked the "DISPLAY VOLUME" command logic
        in performing a "dsksys.disk_info()" call and checking the
        "options" field of each unit entry for a value of "1"
        (advertised to mean READ/WRITE status).

        The tests I performed today, and the results I got were as
        follows:

            o   I logged into OSIRIS:815, userid SUP.SUP.

            o   I put unit D0 into READ ONLY state by flipping the
                switch on the disk drive unit itself.

            o   I issued the command :COPY D0 D1.  In response, the
                following was printed:

            COPY FROM UNIT 00000000 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
                  TO  UNIT 00000001 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
            TOTAL PAGES= 000C7236

                and the "SELECT" light on D0 flickered for one or two
                minutes, appcipated that my error message "FROM UNIT
                NOT READY" would be displayed and the copy operation
                not even attempted.)

            o   I attempted to try to guess what I should say to get
                some status information, issuing a number of commands
                which did no disk writing, and then I issued the
                "LOGOUT" command.

                The response was 

            please log in:

                a sure sign that Ontyme had crashed.  Later
                investigation showed that the reason for the crash was
                "DataBase Offline-FAIL 99"

            o   After switching D0 back to READ/WRITE state, I
                executed the slot using the DDT "E" command and found
                the system up and happy.

            o   I logged in to :815 again as SUP.SUP and issued the
                "DISPLAY VOLUME" command.  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

            o   I then switched D0 into READ ONLY state and repeatedME".  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

                Ten seconds or so later, I repeated the command, and
                received the response:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   DOWN
              1   0   RW


            o   After switching the drive back to READ/WRITE state,
                all succeeding "DISPLAY VOLUME" commands showed the
                unit to be DOWN.  Attempts to FILE large files did not
                cause the "SELECT" light on D0 to flicker.

                This seemed to indicate that once the nucleus has
                decided the unit is down, there is no way to change
                that state, short of re-executing the slot.


        Right now, it seems that the only way to tell if a drive is
        "DOWN" is to try to write to it.  That's ok, but it also seems
        that once a drive is found to be "DOWN", it can never be
        returned to READ/WRITE status.

        Note that the result of the "dsksys.disk_info()" call did not
        accurately reflect the fact that the drive was in READ ONLY
        state.  My guess is that either the nucleus does not really
        understand the disk controller in a number of ways, or the
        disk controller is giving erroneous information.

Subject: Proposed Memo re: soft error counts 


    Adele,
    
    This is a copy of what I intend to send.  I think it sounds better
    than it did.  The distribution list is ANEWMAN, FRICKEL, SLLDCAIN,
    IPC.GHB@Ontyme, MDEMS.B/BARTLETT@Ontyme.  Can you think of anyone
    else?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------


    Here is a proposal for a minor upgrade to the ONLINE PACK COPY
    command in Ontyme which would help avoid copy operations being
    initiated inadvertantly on systems with sick disk drives.

    We would essentially add a step to the operator's procedure for
    the pack copy operation, in which Ontyme would display the number
    of soft disk errors which have occured on each drive since the
    last system initialization or the last pack copy (whichever is
    more recent), and require the operator to answer a question like:

        DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE?

    Making the process of confirming the intent to proceed deliberate
    will provide a means of backing out of the command, either in
    consideration of this error count information, or for other
    reasons (such as the mistaken specification of the source and
    destination devices).

    Please consider this and let us know if you agreee with the
    sentiment, and what version (if any) we might include it in.

Subject: lvol nucleus bug? 

    Martin,

    Please help me.  I need to know what (if anything) is going wrong
    with my use of the nucleus with regard to determining the state of
    the logical disk volumes we are using in Ontyme.

    I recently added some code to the online pack copy logic in Ontyme
    to insure that both logical volumes involved in the transfre are
    in R/W state before allowing the copy operation to be initiated.
    The io call to the nucleus used was

        io(data, parm, lvol, 0);

    where

        parm.operation := lvol_info;

    and my tests of this indicated that the information returned in
    the "options" field of the information record did not accurately
    reflect the actual state of the drive in question. In particular,
    I switched the "from" drive into Read-Only state and found that my
    lvol_info request indicated that the drive was in R/W state.

    Enclosed is a copy of the memo I wrote after doing my tests,
    detailing what I did.  What I would like to know is how to
    reliably tell the state of the logical volumes without causing
    them to go into a state which cannot be changed without
    re-executing the slot.

    Thanks for your consideration,
    
    Ken Dawson (mdems.k/dawson),
    Ontyme Development
                   Does Ontyme really know its disk units?

        I modified the Online Pack Copy command logic in UTLCMD.OSI to
        include a test of the availabilty of both logical units.  This
        was in order to prevent a pack copy operation from being
        initiated if one of the units involved is not in READ/WRITE
        state.

        The code I added mimicked the "DISPLAY VOLUME" command logic
        in performing a "dsksys.disk_info()" call and checking the
        "options" field of each unit entry for a value of "1"
        (advertised to mean READ/WRITE status).

        The tests I performed today, and the results I got were as
        follows:

            o   I logged into OSIRIS:815, userid SUP.SUP.

            o   I put unit D0 into READ ONLY state by flipping the
                switch on the disk drive unit itself.

            o   I issued the command :COPY D0 D1.  In response, the
                following was printed:

            COPY FROM UNIT 00000000 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
                  TO  UNIT 00000001 VOL. 00000000 INCARNATION 00000000
            TOTAL PAGES= 000C7236

                and the "SELECT" light on D0 flickered for one or two
                minutes, appcipated that my error message "FROM UNIT
                NOT READY" would be displayed and the copy operation
                not even attempted.)

            o   I attempted to try to guess what I should say to get
                some status information, issuing a number of commands
                which did no disk writing, and then I issued the
                "LOGOUT" command.

                The response was 

            please log in:

                a sure sign that Ontyme had crashed.  Later
                investigation showed that the reason for the crash was
                "DataBase Offline-FAIL 99"

            o   After switching D0 back to READ/WRITE state, I
                executed the slot using the DDT "E" command and found
                the system up and happy.

            o   I logged in to :815 again as SUP.SUP and issued the
                "DISPLAY VOLUME" command.  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

            o   I then switched D0 into READ ONLY state and repeatedME".  The response was:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   RW
              1   0   RW

                Ten seconds or so later, I repeated the command, and
                received the response:

            UNIT VOL MODE
              0   0   DOWN
              1   0   RW


            o   After switching the drive back to READ/WRITE state,
                all succeeding "DISPLAY VOLUME" commands showed the
                unit to be DOWN.  Attempts to FILE large files did not
                cause the "SELECT" light on D0 to flicker.

                This seemed to indicate that once the nucleus has
                decided the unit is down, there is no way to change
                that state, short of re-executing the slot.


        Right now, it seems that the only way to tell if a drive is
        "DOWN" is to try to write to it.  That's ok, but it also seems
        that once a drive is found to be "DOWN", it can never be
        returned to READ/WRITE status.

        Note that the result of the "dsksys.disk_info()" call did not
        accurately reflect the fact that the drive was in READ ONLY
        state.  My guess is that either the nucleus does not really
        understand the disk controller in a number of ways, or the
        disk controller is giving erroneous information.
