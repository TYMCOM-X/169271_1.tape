:C: THE CUPC ARCUS SYSTEM



                        OFF-SITE STORAGE SYSTEM
                        -------- ------- ------


       ((INTRODUCTION))

            The computer center is the centralized control area for  the
       data  services offered by Tymshare:  it is on the computers where
       all programs applications and information  files  are  processed;
       where  all  the  user's  work  efforts  are  created, maintained,
       updated, distributed  and  so  on.   This  tremendous  importance
       brings with it a tremendous requirement for security.  

            Programs  and  applications  are  products  which  must   be
       safeguarded so they are available to the user as advertised.  All
       work efforts by the user must be secured since much of  the  data
       is  vital  to  the  user's  company,  it's  cash  flow,  payroll,
       inventory, etc.  As one level of precaution, operations maintains
       duplicate  backup  storage  of  the  computer's files on magnetic
       tapes or disk packs.  These  are  kept  'off-line'  as  insurance
       against loss of on-line data.

            But the computer center itself is  vulnerable.   Because  of
       the  vital importance of data generated in the computer center an
       additional level of backup security has  been  established:   the
       ARCUS  'off-site' vital records protection system.  Periodically,
       recent copies of programs, applications and user data in the form
       of  tapes  or  packs,  will be placed in metal containers.  These
       media  containers  will  be  locked  and  stored  in   a   secure
       environment located some distance from the computer center.  This
       provides insurance against loss of  data  due  to  a  natural  or
       planned disaster to the computer center itself.

            For Bay Area computer centers, this off line backup will  be
       maintained  in  vaults in Union City.  This document will outline
       the rotation  schedule  to  and  from  ARCUS,  and  describe  the
       procedures  that  are  to  be  used  for  accessing  data  should
       immediate return be necessary.



       ((SUMMARY))


                                 FILE ROTATION

            1) CUPA OFF-SITE STORAGE IS IN CONTAINERS EACH CONTAINING

            3) ARCUS WILL SEND A DELIVERY TRUCK EVERY WEEKDAY. THIS
               WILL RETURN THE CONTAINERS DUE BACK AT THE CENTER AND
               PICK UP THE CONTAINERS DUE TO GO TO ARCUS.
               THE PACKS IN THE CONTAINERS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN TIME
               FOR THE SCHEDULED PACKCOPY.
                    (SEE THE ROTATION SCHEDULE BELOW)

            4) KEYS FOR THE CANISTERS WILL BE KEPT IN THE KEY CABINET
               AND EACH LEAD AND CENTER MANAGER WILL ALSO HAVE A KEY.

            5) THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION FORM MUST BE FILLED OUT
               BY SOMEONE WITH AN ARCUS I.D. CARD.
                    (SEE A SAMPLE FORM BELOW FOR DETAILS)

            6) THE CUSTOMER COPY SHOULD BE FILED IN THE ARCUS BOOK
               LOCATED IN BRETT'S OFFICE ON THE LEAD OPERATOR
               FILE CABINET.
                    (ON DELIVERY YOU'LL RECIEVE THE RECEIPT)


                            UNSCHEDULED FILE RETURN

            1) IF DATA IS NEEDED FROM ARCUS STORAGE (IN OTHER WORDS
               A PACK SET IS NEEDED TO REBUILD THE 940 DISK) THEN
               CHECK THE ARCUS BOOK TO DETERMINE THE  CONTAINER
               NUMBER WHICH STORES THE DATA. WHEN YOU'VE FOUND THE
               APPROPRIATE SHEET NOTE THE CONTAINER NUMBER AND THE 
               SCHEDULED RETURN DATE.

            2) CALL ARCUS AT:       *** 489-5100 ***

            3) GIVE YOUR ARCUS I.D. NUMBER AND TYMSHARE'S ACCOUNT
               NUMBER:              *** 1185 ***

            4) GIVE THE CONTAINER NUMBER YOU NEED AND THE SCHEDULED
               RETURN DATE FROM THE PICKUP AUTHORIZATION FORM.
               REMEMBER THAT ONLY ENTIRE CONTAINER(S) WILL BE
               RETURNED. ARCUS WILL NEVER OPEN A CONTAINER AND
               RETURN ONLY PART OF IT'S CONTENTS. THE REQUESTED
               CANISTER(S) SHOULD ARRIVE IN APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS.
