                                GENERAL
                                -------

       THIS SESSION WILL DISCUSS  THE  INSTRUCTIONS  NECESSARY  FOR  THE
       OPERATION  ON  THE 9171 AND 9379 LINE PRINTERS.  UNLESS OTHERWISE
       INDICATED, THE SINGLE REFERENCE TO PRINTER  REFERS  TO  BOTH  THE
       9171 AND THE 9379 LINE PRINTERS.

                               OPERATION
                               ---------

       DETAILS OF THE PRINTER REQUIRED  FOR  PROPER  OPERATION  WILL  BE
       PRESENTED.  MODES OF OPERATION WILL BE DISCUSSED, FOLLOWED BY THE
       FUNCTIONS  OF  CONTROLS  AND  INDICATORS  AS  THE  BASIS  FOR   A
       DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC OPERATING PROCEDURES.

                             CONTROL PANEL
                             -------------

       CONTROLS AVAILABLE FOR THE ELECTRONIC OPERATION OF THE  9171  AND
       9379  LINE  PRINTERS  ARE  MOUNTED  ON A PANEL ON THE UPPER RIGHT
       FRONT CORNER OF THE CABINET (SEE FIGURE 1).  THE FUNCTION OF  THE
       CONTROLS ON THIS PANEL ARE:

           POWER ON-SWITCH INDICATOR       APPLIES POWER TO ALL MOTORS.
                                           UPPER HALF OF SWITCH ILLUM-

                                           AFTER OPERATION OF SWITCH.

           READY-SWITCH-INDICATOR          ENABLES COMMUNICATION
                                           BETWEEN PRINTER AND
                                           COMPUTER.

           TOP OF FORM SWITCH-INDICATOR    CAUSES PAPER TO MOVE TO TOP
                                           OF NEXT FORM IF READY SWITCH
                                           IS OFF.  ILLUMINATES WHEN
                                           PAPER IS SITUATED AT TOP OF
                                           PAGE.

           SINGLE SPACE SWITCH-INDICATOR   CAUSES PAPER TO SPACE
                                           VERTICALLY ONE LINE IF
                                           READY SWITCH IS OFF.

           MANUAL/OFF LINE SWITCH-         USED EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE

           FAULT INDICATOR                 ILLUMINATED WHEN PARITY
                                           ERROR IS DETECTED DURING
                                           PRINTING.

                          ADDITIONAL CONTROLS
                          -------------------

       MECHANICAL AND ELECTRONIC CONTROLS ARE ALSO  AVAILABLE  ELSEWHERE
       WITHIN  THE PRINTER.  RIBBON MOUNTING ROLLERS ARE ACCESSIBLE FROM
       THE TOP FRONT OF THE PRINTER (SEE FIGURE 2.) THE OUTPUT  TRACTORS
       THAT   PULL  THE  PAPER  OUT  OF  THE  PRINTER  ARE  INDIVIDUALLY
       SLIDE-MOUNTED ON A SLOTTED SHAFT TO  PERMIT  DIFFERENT  SIZES  OF
       PAPER  FORMS  TO  BE  USED.   THE TRACTOR LOCK IS USED FOR COARSE
       ADJUSTMENTS.  THE FINE LATERAL ADJUSTMENT IS  USED  TO  MOVE  THE
       ENTIRE  SHAFT  TO  BRING  THE  FRONT AND REAR TRACTORS INTO EXACT
       ALIGNMENT.  THE FINE ADJUSTMENT CAN  ALSO  BE  USED  FOR  PRECISE
       ALIGNMENT  OF  THE  PRINTED  LINE WITH THE PAPER FORM.  THE INPUT
       TRACTORS ARE ALSO MOUNTED ON A SPLINED SHAFT AT THE REAR  OF  THE
       PRINTER  (SEE  FIGURE  3.)  THE  ADJUSTMENT FEATURES ON THE INPUT
       TRACTORS ARE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE ON THE  OUTPUT  TRACTORS.   THE
       FORM  TENSION  LEVER,  ALSO  LOCATED  ON THE REAR OF THE PRINTER,
       ADJUSTS THE TENSION EXERTED ON THE PAPER BETWEEN  THE  FRONT  AND
       REAR  TRACTORS.   PAPER IS FED TO THE PRINTER FROM A SHELF BEHIND
       THE PRINTER.

       VARIOUS CONTROLS ARE LOCATED BEHIND A  HINGED  PANEL  WHICH  OPEN
       FROM THE TOP ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PRINTER (SEE FIGURE 4.) THE
       VERTICAL FORMAT UNIT IS USED TO CONTROL  VERTICAL  PAPER  FORMAT.
       SPOOLS ON THE VERTICAL FORMAT UNIT ARE MOVABLE TO ENABLE TAPES OF
       VARIOUS LENGTHS TO BE MOUNTED ON THE UNIT.   THE  VERTICAL  PRINT
       LINE ADJUSTMENT PERMITS MOVEMENT OF THE PAPER DRIVE SHAFT SO THAT
       CHARACTERS ARE PRINTED ON THE LINES OF THE  PAPER.   THE  PHASING
       CONTROL IS USED TO VARY THE TIME THAT THE LINE HAMMER STRIKES THE
       PAPER.  CORRECT PHASING RESULTS IN THE  PRINTING  OF  THE  ENTIRE
       CHARACTER.  INCORRECT PHASING CAN RESULT IN THE PRINTING OF PARTS
       OF ADJACENT CHARACTERS ALONG WITH  THE  DESIRED  CHARACTER.   THE
       SETTING  OF  THE  PHASING  CONTROL CHANGES WITH THE KIND OF PAPER
       BEING USED, ALSO WITH THE NUMBER OF COPIES BEING PRINTED AND WHEN
       INTENSITY  IS CHANGED.  THE INTENSITY CONTROL IS USED TO VARY THE
       AMOUNT OF CURRENT  SUPPLIED  TO  THE  HAMMER  DRIVE  CIRCUITS  TO
       CONTROL  THE  FORCE WITH WHICH THE HAMMER STRIKES THE PAPER.  THE
       INTENSITY CONTROL CHANGES WITH THE NUMBER OF FORMS BEING  PRINTED
       AND  WITH  THE  INK CONTENT OF THE RIBBON.  THE CRANK USED IN THE
       RIBBON REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE IS HOUSED  INSIDE  THIS  COMPARTMENT
       (SEE  FIGURE  4.)  THE  LOCATION OF THE TWO SHAFTS MOVABLE BY THE
       CRANK ARE ALSO INSIDE THIS COMPARTMENT.

                          OPERATING PROCEDURES
                          --------------------

       THE MAIN PROCEDURES REQUIRED FOR OPERATION OF THE 9171  AND  9379
       LINE PRINTERS ARE:
                                                                  Page 4

           E.  PHASING CONTROL.

           F.  VERTICAL PRINT LINE ADJUSTMENT.

           G.  INTENSITY CONTROL ADJUSTMENT.

       A.  RIBBON LOADING
           --------------

       WHEN THE RIBBON BECOMES UNUSABLE, IT MUST BE  REPLACED  WITH  ONE
       HAVING  THE  SPECIFICATIONS  OF 14.5 INCHES IN WIDTH, 36 YARDS IN
       LENGTH, ALL  PURPOSE  NYLON,  AND  BLACK  COLOR.   THE  FOLLOWING
       PROCEDURE IS USED TO LOAD A NEW RIBBON INTO THE PRINTER.


                                     NOTE

           BEFORE STARTING THE RIBBON LOADING  PROCEDURE,  NOTE  THE
           POSITION  ON  THE  MANDRELS.  THE RIBBON AND MANDRELS ARE
           NOT SYMMETRICAL, AND REPLACEMENT IN THE INVERTED POSITION
           COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PRINTOUT (SEE FIGURE 5.)



           1.  REMOVE MANDREL WITHOUT A CARDBOARD SLEEVE FROM SPRING
               LOADED MOUNTING.

           2.  REMOVE KEY FROM MANDREL.

           3.  SLIDE NEW RIBBON ONTO MANDREL TO UNWIND AND SET RIBBON
               FIRMLY AGAINST THE COLLAR.

           4.  REPLACE KEY IN SLOT OF SPOOL AND SEAT FIRMLY IN SLOT OF
               SLEEVE.

           5.  REPLACE SPOOL IN SPRING LOADED MOUNTING.

           6.  THREAD RIBBON AROUND FRONT RIBBON GUIDE BAR, BETWEEN
               TYPELINE SHIELD AND PAPER TABLE, OVER REAR RIBBON GUIDE
               BAR, AND ONTO THE RIBBON SPOOL.

           7.  CENTER RIBBON ON CARDBOARD SLEEVE AND ASSURE THAT THE
               LEADER SLOT IS ALIGNED WITH THE SLOT IN THE SLEEVE.

           8.  SECURE THE RIBBON TO THE CARDBOARD SLEEVE BY TAPING.
                                                                  Page 5
PAPER LOADING


       B.  PAPER LOADING
           -------------

       THE PAPER MUST BE PROPERLY LOADED BEFORE OPERATING  THE  PRINTER.
       THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE IS TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN LOADING PAPER.

           1.  RELAX PAPER TENSION MECHANISM BY LOWERING FORM TENSION
               LEVER TO ITS LOWEST POSITION.

           2.  LOOSEN INPUT TRACTOR LOCKS AND LATERALLY POSITION
               TRACTORS TO RECEIVE PAPER.

           3.  POSITION OUTPUT TRACTORS RELATIVE TO INPUT TRACTORS USING
               COLUMNAR SCALES.

           4.  THREAD PAPER BETWEEN TYPELINE SHIELD AND PAPER TABLE.

           5.  MOUNT PAPER ON LEFT INPUT TRACTOR SPROCKETS AND CLOSE
               TRACTOR GUIDE PLATE.

           6.  TIGHTEN LEFT INPUT TRACTOR LOCK.

           7.  ADJUST RIGHT INPUT TRACTOR LATERALLY UNTIL PAPER SPROCKET
               HOLES ARE CENTERED OVER THE TRACTOR SPROCKETS.

           8.  TIGHTEN RIGHT INPUT TRACTOR LOCK AND CLOSE TRACTOR GUIDE
               PLATE.

           9.  REPEAT STEPS 6 THROUGH 8 FOR OUTPUT TRACTORS.



                                     NOTE

           LATERAL ADJUSTMENT OF BOTH INPUT OR OUTPUT  TRACTORS  CAN
           BE  MADE  BY  THE  USE  OF  THE  FINE  LATERAL ADJUSTMENT
           CONTROLS.  THESE ALLOW SIMULTANEOUS LATERAL ADJUSTMENT OF
           BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT TRACTORS.



          10.  INCREASE PAPER TENSION BY RAISING FORM TENSION LEVEL
               UNTIL THE HOLES IN THE PAPER ARE SLIGHTLY DEFORMED.
                                                                  Page 6
TAPE LOADING


       C.  TAPE LOADING
           ------------

       THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE  IS  TO  BE  USED  FOR  LOADING  STANDARD
       PREPUNCHED AND PRECUT TAPE LOOP.

           1.  MOVE TAPE SPOOLS TO ALLOW TAPE TO BE MOUNTED.

           2.  RAISE SENSING HEAD.

           3.  PLACE TAPE LOOP ONTO SPOOLS WITH THE EDGE NUMBERS
               INCREASING IN THE CLOCKWISE DIRECTION.



                                     NOTE

           EIGHT CHANNEL TAPES ARE SYMMETRICAL SO CARE MUST BE TAKEN
           TO PREVENT LOADING THE TAPE BACKWARDS.



           4.  TAKE UP TAPE SLACK BY ADJUSTING THE SPOOLS UNTIL THE TAPE
               IS SEATED ON SPOOLS.  DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN BECAUSE
               EXCESSIVE TENSION ON THE TAPE CAUSES EXCESSIVE
               WEAR.

           5.  LOWER SENSING HEAD.
                                                                  Page 7
TURN ON-TURN OFF PROCEDURES


       D.  TURN ON-TURN OFF PROCEDURES
           ---------------------------

       THE TURN ON-TURN OFF PROCEDURES ARE PERFORMED WITH  THE  CONTROLS
       DESCRIBED  IN  THE  'CONTROL PANEL' PARAGRAPH ABOVE.  THE PRINTER
       CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT  POWER  BEING  SUPPLIED.   WHEN  COMPUTER
       POWER  IS ON, THE POWER ON SWITCH CONTROLS THE POWER TO THE DRIVE
       MOTORS AND  THE  POWER  SUPPLY  IN  THE  PRINTER  AND  THE  POWER
       INDICATOR  WILL  LIGHT.  A TIME DELAY OF APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS
       ALLOWS THE MOTORS TO REACH OPERATIONAL SPEED AND THE POWER SUPPLY
       TO  STABILIZE.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS 20 SECONDS, THE ON PART
       OF THE POWER ON SWITCH IS ILLUMINATED.



                                     NOTE

           IF A POWER FAILURE SHOULD OCCUR AT  ANY  TIME  AFTER  THE
           START  OF  TRANSMISSION  OF  THE LINE TO THE PRINTER, THE
           LINE WILL  BE  PRINTED  BEFORE  THE  POWER  DROPS  TO  AN
           UNUSABLE LEVEL.



       E.  PHASING CONTROL
           ---------------

       PERFORMANCE OF THE FOLLOWING  PROCEDURE  IS  REQUIRED  ONLY  WHEN
       CHANGING  TYPES  OF  PAPER OR CHANGING THE NUMBER OF COPIES BEING
       PRINTED.  ALSO WHEN INTENSITY IS CHANGED.

           1.  FEED IN KNOWN DATA.

           2.  OBSERVE PRINTOUT FOR CORRECT DATA.

           3.  IF PRINTOUT IS GARBLED OR PARTIAL CHARACTERS ARE BEING
               PRINTED (GHOSTING), ADJUST PHASING CONTROL LOCATED ABOVE
               THE CODE DISC TO OBTAIN GOOD PRINTOUT.

           4.  MAINTAIN A RECORD OF PHASING CONTROL SETTING FOR EACH
               TYPE OF FORM USED.

       F.  VERTICAL PRINT LINE ADJUSTMENT
           ------------------------------

       IF CHARACTERS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH LINES ON  THE  PAPER,  PERFORM
       THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENT.

           1.  FEED IN DATA.

           2.  OBSERVE PRINTOUT.

           3.  ADJUST VERTICAL PRINT LINE ADJUSTMENT CONTROL FOR
               PROPER PRINT POSITION.

                                                                  Page 8
INTENSITY CONTROL ADJUSTMENT


       G.  INTENSITY CONTROL ADJUSTMENT
           ----------------------------

       PERFORM THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENT WHEN THE PRINT INTENSITY OF  THE
       OUTPUT IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THE INTENSITY CONTROL SETTINGS WILL VARY
       WITH THE NUMBER OF FORMS AND THE AGE OF THE RIBBON.

           1.  FEED IN KNOWN DATA.

           2.  OBSERVE PRINTOUT FOR CORRECT DATA.

           3.  IF PRINTOUT IS TOO LIGHT, INCREASE INTENSITY CONTROL.
               IF PRINTOUT IS TOO DARK, DECREASE INTENSITY CONTROL.
               CHECK PHASING CONTROL.

           4.  MAINTAIN A RECORD OF THE INTENSITY CONTROL SETTINGS
               FOR EACH TYPE OF FORM USED.
